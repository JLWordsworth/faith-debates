# Faith Debates - Design Document

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** Approved

## Overview

A fully automated AI-powered theological/spiritual debate system using Claude Code experimental agent teams. Users provide a debate topic, and the system automatically researches positions, generates personas, conducts a structured debate, and produces evaluations.

## Key Requirements

1. **Single input:** User provides only a debate topic
2. **Automated workflow:** Research → Position generation → Debate → Evaluation → Summary
3. **Agent teams:** Uses Claude Code experimental agent teams feature
4. **Generic/reusable:** Works for any theological or spiritual debate topic
5. **Bible reference:** Includes Berean Standard Bible for scriptural debates

```

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Research (Parallel)

**Researcher A** and **Researcher B** work in parallel:
- Analyze the debate topic
- Identify the two opposing positions
- Research arguments and scriptures
- Generate `position-a.md` and `position-b.md`

Researchers coordinate via direct messaging to:
- Avoid duplicating scripture references
- Share findings
- Ensure balanced coverage

### Phase 2: Debate (Structured)

**Moderator** orchestrates the debate:

1. **Opening Statements** (3-5 paragraphs each)
2. **First Rebuttals** (4-6 paragraphs each)
3. **Second Rebuttals** (3-5 paragraphs each, optional)
4. **Cross-Examination** (3 questions per side)
5. **Closing Statements** (3-5 paragraphs each)

**Debater A** and **Debater B**:
- Load personas from generated position files
- Debate according to their assigned position
- Maintain respectful, charitable discourse

### Phase 3: Evaluation

**Judge**:
- Reads all transcript files
- Scores each debater (100-point system):
  - Argument Quality (40 pts)
  - Response Quality (30 pts)
  - Debate Conduct (20 pts)
  - Argument Effectiveness (10 pts)
- Writes `judgment.md` with analysis and verdict

**Summarizer**:
- Reads all debate files
- Creates `summary.md` for non-theological audiences
- Explains terms in plain language
- Maintains neutrality

## Agent Team Features Used

| Feature | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| Direct messaging | Researchers coordinate; debaters respond to moderator |
| Broadcast | Moderator announces new debate phases |
| Shared task list | Lead assigns and tracks tasks |
| Independent contexts | Each teammate maintains their role/persona |
| Idle notifications | Lead knows when teammates finish |

## Environment Setup

```bash
# Enable experimental agent teams
export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS="1"
```

Or in `settings.json`:
```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```

## Agent Definitions

### Researcher A / Researcher B
- Research one side of the debate topic
- Generate position file with:
  - Position name and description
  - Core beliefs/arguments
  - Key scriptures or authorities
  - Debate style/tone guidance
- Coordinate with the other researcher

### Debater A / Debater B
- Load persona from position file
- Present and defend their position
- Use scripture appropriately (Bible available at `bible/bsb_usfm/`)
- Engage charitably with opponent

### Moderator
- Ensure fair debate conduct
- Enforce debate structure
- Manage transitions between phases
- Maintain respectful discourse

### Judge
- Evaluate debate performance impartially
- Score using defined criteria
- Provide detailed analysis
- Render verdict without declaring which theology is "correct"

### Summarizer
- Create accessible summaries for non-theological audiences
- Explain theological terms plainly
- Maintain neutrality
- Focus on core questions and disagreements

## File Naming Conventions

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `position-a.md` | First position (generated) |
| `position-b.md` | Second position (generated) |
| `moderator-intro.md` | Topic introduction |
| `opening-a.md` | Debater A opening statement |
| `opening-b.md` | Debater B opening statement |
| `rebuttal-1-a.md` | Debater A first rebuttal |
| `rebuttal-1-b.md` | Debater B first rebuttal |
| `rebuttal-2-a.md` | Debater A second rebuttal |
| `rebuttal-2-b.md` | Debater B second rebuttal |
| `cross-exam-a.md` | Debater A cross-examination questions |
| `cross-exam-b.md` | Debater B cross-examination questions |
| `xr-responses-a.md` | Debater A cross-exam responses |
| `xr-responses-b.md` | Debater B cross-exam responses |
| `closing-a.md` | Debater A closing statement |
| `closing-b.md` | Debater B closing statement |
| `judgment.md` | Judge's evaluation |
| `summary.md` | Accessible summary |

## User Interface

Users create debates via natural language:

```
User: Create a debate on whether Christians can lose their salvation
```

Or via a skill:

```
/debate "Are spiritual gifts for today?"
```

## Differences from calv-v-arm

| Aspect | calv-v-arm | faith-debates |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Topic scope | Fixed (Calvinism vs Arminianism) | Any topic |
| Position files | Manually created | Auto-generated by researchers |
| Personas | Hardcoded agents | Dynamic, loaded from position files |
| Research | Manual | Automated via researcher agents |
| User input | Multiple steps | Single topic |

## Success Criteria

- User can create a complete debate with a single command
- Researchers generate balanced, well-researched position files
- Debate proceeds smoothly through all phases
- Judge provides fair, detailed evaluations
- Summarizer creates accessible summaries
- Agent team coordination works seamlessly

## Next Steps

1. Invoke `writing-plans` skill to create implementation plan
2. Implement agent definitions
3. Create team configurations
4. Add Bible reference
5. Create documentation
6. Test with sample debate topics
