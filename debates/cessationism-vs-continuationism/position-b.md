# Position B: Continuationism

## Position Name
**Continuationism** (also known as Charismatic Continuationism)

## Core Beliefs

- **All spiritual gifts remain available**: The gifts of the Spirit described in the New Testament—including tongues, prophecy, healing, miracles, and other charismatic gifts—continue to be available to the church throughout the present age.

- **No biblical evidence of cessation**: There is no explicit scriptural teaching indicating that any spiritual gifts would cease before the return of Christ; the "perfect" in 1 Corinthians 13:10 refers to the consummation of all things at Christ's return, not the completion of the New Testament canon.

- **Spirit's ongoing work**: The Holy Spirit continues to distribute gifts "to each one individually as He wills" (1 Corinthians 12:11) for the edification, exhortation, and comfort of the church (1 Corinthians 14:3).

- **Continuity between apostolic and contemporary church**: The church throughout history, not merely the apostolic era, is called to demonstrate the power of the Kingdom through spiritual gifts; God does not change His methods or diminish His power.

- **Gifts are for the entire church age**: The New Testament presents spiritual gifts as normative for the church until Christ's return, with instructions given for their orderly exercise rather than their discontinuation.

- **Discernment required, not dismissal**: While acknowledging genuine abuses and counterfeits, continuationists maintain the proper response is biblical discernment and testing (1 Thessalonians 5:19-21; 1 John 4:1), not rejection of all charismatic phenomena.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The "Perfect" Has Not Yet Come
Continuationists argue that 1 Corinthians 13:8-12 indicates that prophecies, tongues, and knowledge will cease "when the perfect comes." The passage contrasts "that which is partial" with "the perfect" (Greek: *to teleion*) using the metaphor of childhood giving way to adulthood and a mirror reflection giving way to face-to-face vision. This strongly suggests reference to the eschatological consummation at Christ's return, not the closing of the canon. The "face-to-face" language corresponds to 1 John 3:2 ("we shall see Him as He is"), indicating the cessation of gifts awaits the age to come.

### 2. No Biblical Teaching on Cessation
Continuationists emphasize the absence of any explicit scriptural statement that miraculous gifts would cease. The New Testament contains extensive instructions for the proper use of tongues (1 Corinthians 14), prophecy (1 Corinthians 14:29-33), and other gifts—instructions that would be unnecessary if these gifts were about to cease. Paul's command to "eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy" (1 Corinthians 14:1) and "do not forbid speaking in tongues" (1 Corinthians 14:39) presumes ongoing operation.

### 3. The Nature of Pentecost
The outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, described in Acts 2 and interpreted by Peter as fulfilling Joel's prophecy ("in the last days I will pour out my Spirit"), marks the beginning of the church age rather than a brief apostolic period. Joel's prophecy extends to "the day of the Lord" (Acts 2:20), suggesting the Spirit's charismatic work continues throughout the entire present age. The "last days" began at Pentecost and continue until Christ's return.

### 4. The Universal and Normative Pattern
The New Testament portrays spiritual gifts as distributed throughout the church, not limited to the apostles. Romans 12:6-8, 1 Corinthians 12:7-11, and 1 Peter 4:10-11 all address gifts distributed among ordinary believers. The Corinthians church, filled with problems and immaturity, is instructed in the proper use of gifts rather than told they would cease. Similarly, Paul instructs the Thessalonian believers to "do not treat prophecies with contempt but test them all" (1 Thessalonians 5:20-21), assuming ongoing prophetic activity.

### 5. Theological Consistency of God's Character
Continuationists argue that God's character does not change (Malachi 3:6; Hebrews 13:8) and that His desire to demonstrate His power through His people remains constant. The cessationist position, by requiring a major shift in how God operates without clear scriptural warrant, creates a problematic theological discontinuity. If God used miracles and gifts to authenticate the gospel in the first century, the need for such authentication remains in every age and culture.

## Scriptural Support

### Key Passages Supporting Continuationism

**1 Corinthians 12:4-11** (BSB): "There are different gifts, but the same Spirit. There are different ministries, but the same Lord. There are different ways of working, but the same God works all things in all men. Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good... to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in various tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues."

**1 Corinthians 13:8-12** (BSB): "Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be restrained; where there is knowledge, it will be dismissed. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away... For now we see but a faint reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known."

**1 Corinthians 14:1-5, 39** (BSB): "Earnestly pursue love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy... I wish that all of you could speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy... So, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues."

**Acts 2:17-21, 38-39** (BSB): "'In the last days,' God says, 'I will pour out My Spirit on all people... I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below... And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.'... Peter replied, 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. This promise belongs to you and your children and to all who are far off—to all whom the Lord our God will call to Himself.'"

**Romans 12:6-8** (BSB): "We have different gifts according to the grace given us. If one's gift is prophecy, let him use it in proportion to his faith; if it is serving, let him serve; if it is teaching, let him teach; if it is encouraging, let him encourage; if it is giving, let him give generously; if it is leading, let him lead with diligence; if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully."

**1 Thessalonians 5:19-21** (BSB): "Do not treat prophecies with contempt. But test all things. Hold fast to what is good."

**Hebrews 2:4** (BSB): "and was affirmed by God through signs, wonders, various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to His will."

**1 Peter 4:10-11** (BSB): "As good stewards of the manifold grace of God, each of you should use whatever gift he has received to serve one another."

**Mark 16:17-18** (BSB): "And these signs will accompany those who believe: In My name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will be made well."

**James 5:14-15** (BSB): "Is any one of you sick? He should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick."

## Historical Context

### Early Church Through the Middle Ages
Continuationists note that accounts of spiritual gifts, particularly miracles and healing, appear throughout church history. While acknowledged that these accounts diminished in frequency during the medieval period, continuationists argue this reflects spiritual decline rather than divine withdrawal.

### The Reformation Era
The Reformation emphasized sola scriptura, but did not systematically argue for cessationism. Most Reformers, including Luther and Calvin, acknowledged God's ability to work miracles but were cautious about claims of new revelation.

### Modern Renewal Movements
The continuationist position gained prominence through several 20th-century movements:
- The Pentecostal revival (1906, Azusa Street) emphasized tongues and healing as normative
- The Charismatic movement (1960s-70s) brought charismatic practices into mainline denominations
- The Third Wave or "Signs and Wonders" movement (1980s) emphasized power evangelism while being more cautious about tongues

### Theological Diversity
Continuationism exists across the evangelical spectrum, from classical Pentecostals (who tongues as evidence of Spirit baptism) to charismatics in Reformed and Baptist traditions (who see tongues as one gift among many). The Third Wave movement, associated with John Wimber and the Vineyard, represents a continuationist position that emphasizes power ministry while being cautious about emotional excess.

## Debate Style Guidance

### Tone and Approach
- **Charitable first**: Acknowledge that cessationist brothers and sisters are genuinely seeking to honor God's Word and protect the church from error. Many have witnessed abuses in charismatic circles.
- **Biblically focused**: Ground all arguments in specific Scripture passages rather than personal experience or anecdotes alone. While experience can illustrate biblical truths, Scripture remains the authority.
- **Honest about challenges**: Acknowledge real problems within some continuationist circles—emotionalism, fabrication, false prophecies, financial exploitation—while maintaining these are abuses, not reasons to reject the genuine work of the Spirit.

### Key Discussion Points to Emphasize
1. **The hermeneutical question**: How do we interpret 1 Corinthians 13:8-12? Context and language strongly support the "perfect" as Christ's return, not the canon.

2. **The absence of cessation teaching**: Point out that the New Testament consistently instructs believers in the proper use of gifts rather than teaching they would cease. This is significant—if God planned to cease gifts, why no clear teaching on it?

3. **The theological problem**: A God who changes His operating methods without clear explanation raises theological difficulties. If the gospel needed authentication in the first century, does it not need it today?

4. **Global church perspective**: Note that the majority of the global church—particularly in the Global South—is continuationist and experiences regular charismatic activity. This is not a fringe position.

5. **The proper alternative to abuse**: The biblical solution to counterfeit gifts is not to reject all gifts, but to exercise discernment (1 Thessalonians 5:20-21; 1 John 4:1).

### Avoid
- **Experience-arguments** apart from Scripture: "I know it's real because I experienced it" is not a sufficient argument for a brother who prioritizes Scripture.
- **Challenging motives**: Do not suggest cessationists lack faith or are quenching the Spirit. They genuinely believe their position honors Scripture.
- **Ignoring real abuses**: Do not dismiss concerns about charismatic excess; address them directly with biblical solutions.

### Recommended Approach
- Begin with the exegetical case from Scripture, particularly 1 Corinthians 12-14.
- Address the cessationist interpretation of 1 Corinthians 13:10 directly and respectfully.
- Acknowledge the need for discernment while maintaining that discernment implies the genuine exists alongside the counterfeit.
- Emphasize that continuationism is about God's ongoing power and presence, not about spiritual superiority.
