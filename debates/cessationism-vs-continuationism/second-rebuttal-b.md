# Second Rebuttal - Position B: Continuationism

I remain grateful for my opponent's charitable engagement and thoughtful arguments. The cessationist position is articulated with rigor and sincerity, and I appreciate the opportunity to address the specific challenges raised in this second round. I will respond to each of the key arguments advanced against continuationism.

## Ephesians 4: Distinguishing Between Offices and Gifts

My opponent argues that the "until" of Ephesians 4:13 applies only to the collective function of the listed offices, and that apostles and prophets can be distinguished as "foundational" and therefore temporary, while pastors and teachers continue. This argument requires careful examination.

The distinction my opponent draws between "foundational" and "edificatory" offices reads a temporal qualification into Ephesians 2:20 that the text itself does not state. Ephesians 2:20 identifies apostles and prophets as the foundation, but nothing in that text—or anywhere in Scripture—states that prophetic gifts would cease once the foundation was laid. The foundation metaphor speaks to the unique role of apostles and prophets in establishing the church's doctrine and structure, but it does not logically entail that all prophetic activity would thereafter cease. Moreover, if the temporary nature of foundational offices necessitates the cessation of associated gifts, we must ask: were the prophetic giftings mentioned in Romans 12:6, 1 Corinthians 12:10, and 1 Peter 4:10 also temporary? These passages address gifts distributed among ordinary believers, not merely the foundational office of prophet.

Regarding evangelists, my opponent notes that cessationism does not claim their cessation. This concession actually weakens the cessationist case. If Ephesians 4:11-13 lists five offices and cessationism acknowledges that three of them (evangelists, pastors, teachers) continue, on what basis do we insist that apostles and prophets have ceased? The text provides no such distinction. My opponent's position requires importing a categorical distinction not found in the passage itself.

## 1 Corinthians 13: The Perfect and the Face-to-Face Vision

My opponent argues that the "face-to-face" vision of 1 Corinthians 13:12 refers to complete revelation rather than eschatological vision, and that if "the perfect" refers to Christ's return, the cessationist interpretation about when gifts cease becomes irrelevant. This argument merits careful response.

The contrast in 1 Corinthians 13:12 is indeed between "knowing in part" and "knowing fully, even as I am fully known." My opponent suggests this refers to the transition from partial revelation to complete revelation at canon completion. But this interpretation faces a serious problem: does the completed canon provide the kind of comprehensive knowledge Paul describes—knowledge equivalent to being fully known by God? Scripture itself acknowledges that much remains mystery even with the completed canon (1 Corinthians 13:12; Deuteronomy 29:29). The canon provides sufficient revelation for faith and practice, but not the exhaustive knowledge Paul describes.

The "face-to-face" language is universally used in Scripture to denote direct, unmediated encounter with God or Christ (Genesis 32:30; Exodus 33:11; Matthew 5:8; 1 Corinthians 13:12; 1 John 3:2). My opponent's interpretation would require Paul to use this distinctive phrase in a unique, non-eschatological sense—reading against the grain of biblical usage.

My opponent asks what status contemporary prophecies have relative to Scripture if prophecy continues. This is a fair question that continuationists must address. The New Testament provides a framework: prophetic utterances are to be "weighed" (1 Corinthians 14:29) and "tested" (1 Thessalonians 5:20-21; 1 John 4:1). Unlike Scripture, which carries binding authority, contemporary prophecy is subject to the church's discernment and is subordinate to Scripture. The existence of such a category is not without precedent: Agabus's prophecy in Acts 21:11 was genuine but not on par with Scripture, and the Corinthian prophets were subject to evaluation by other prophets. The cessationist claim that the New Testament knows nothing of "fallible prophecy" is overstated; the New Testament assumes the need for discernment precisely because prophetic utterances could be genuine yet require evaluation.

## The Breadth of Distribution and Historical Patterns

My opponent argues that if sign gifts were meant to be normative, why were they clustered in the apostolic period and largely absent in the Apostolic Fathers? This historical argument deserves attention.

However, the historical argument cuts both ways. The cessationist position must explain why, if gifts ceased with the apostles, the New Testament contains no explicit teaching to that effect. Why instruct believers to eagerly desire gifts (1 Corinthians 14:1), not forbid tongues (1 Corinthians 14:39), and test prophecies (1 Thessalonians 5:20-21) if these practices were about to permanently cease? The cessationist position requires that Paul and the other New Testament authors failed to provide clear instruction about a major transition in the Spirit's operations—a transition that, if true, would have prevented centuries of confusion and error.

Regarding the Apostolic Fathers, it is true that their writings do not emphasize miraculous gifts. But they also do not teach that such gifts have ceased. Their silence is not evidence of cessation, particularly given that their writings were not intended to address charismatic practices comprehensively. Moreover, church history after the Apostolic Fathers contains numerous accounts of miracles and charismatic activity, particularly in contexts of mission and persecution. The historical record is more mixed than the cessationist argument suggests.

## Extra-Biblical Revelation and the Sufficiency of Scripture

My opponent argues that cessationism is an inference from Scripture, not an extra-biblical addition, while continuationism faces the challenge of relating contemporary prophecy to the completed canon. I must respectfully maintain that the cessationist position itself requires a categorical restriction not found in Scripture.

Scripture never states that revelatory gifts would cease with the completion of the canon. The cessationist inference depends on linking Ephesians 2:20, 1 Corinthians 13:8-12, Hebrews 2:3-4, and the pattern of redemptive history in a specific way. But this synthesis is not the only possible reading of these texts, nor is it explicitly taught. By contrast, continuationism rests on the plain reading of 1 Corinthians 13:8-12 ("when the perfect comes") and the absence of any scriptural teaching that gifts would cease before Christ's return.

The continuationist position does not threaten the sufficiency of Scripture. Contemporary prophecy, properly understood, does not add to Scripture but provides Spirit-given guidance that must be tested and weighed by Scripture. The canon remains the final authority, and nothing in continuationism undermines this.

## Conclusion

The cessationist case, while thoughtful and well-intentioned, ultimately requires importing distinctions and categorical restrictions not found in Scripture itself. The "perfect" has not yet come, and until it does, the Spirit continues to distribute gifts as He wills for the edification of Christ's church. The biblical solution to counterfeit gifts is not to deny all gifts, but discernment—testing all things and holding fast to what is good.
