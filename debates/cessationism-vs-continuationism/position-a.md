# Position A: Cessationism

## Position Name
**Cessationism** - The theological position that certain spiritual gifts (tongues, prophecy, miraculous healings, and other sign gifts) ceased with the end of the apostolic era and the completion of the New Testament canon.

## Core Beliefs

- **Sufficiency of Scripture**: The completed Bible is God's full and final revelation to His people, rendering revelatory gifts unnecessary and inoperative for the church today.

- **Foundational Role of Apostles and Prophets**: Apostles and prophets served a unique, temporary role in laying the church's foundation (Ephesians 2:20). With that foundation complete, their office and associated sign gifts have ceased.

- **Sign Gifts as Authentication**: Miraculous gifts served primarily to authenticate new divine revelation and confirm the apostolic messengers of Christ (2 Corinthians 12:12, Hebrews 2:3-4).

- **Canon Completion as the "Perfect"**: The "perfect" of 1 Corinthians 13:10 refers to the completed canon of Scripture, at which point partial revelatory gifts passed away.

- **General Sovereignty Over Miracles**: While God remains capable of performing miracles, He no longer gifts individuals with ongoing miraculous abilities as normative church practice.

- **Ordinary Means of Grace**: God now works primarily through ordinary means—the preaching of Scripture, prayer, and the sacraments—rather than extraordinary sign gifts.

- **Continuity of Non-Sign Gifts**: Many cessationists affirm that "non-revelatory, non-sign" gifts (teaching, administration, mercy, etc.) continue to operate in the church.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Foundational Argument (Ephesians 2:19-20)
The church is "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the cornerstone." Foundations are laid once, not repeatedly. Apostles and prophets were uniquely endowed with revelatory gifts to establish this foundation. Once the foundation was complete, their distinctive office and accompanying sign gifts were no longer needed.

### 2. The Canonical Argument (1 Corinthians 13:8-13)
Paul states that prophecies will cease, tongues will be stilled, and partial knowledge will pass away "when the perfect comes." Cessationists understand "the perfect" (to teleion) to refer to the complete revelation of God in the New Testament canon—contrasted with the "partial" (ek merous) prophetic revelations of the apostolic era. Once the canon was complete, the partial revelatory gifts were no longer necessary.

### 3. The Authentication Argument (2 Corinthians 12:12; Hebrews 2:3-4)
Sign gifts (miracles, wonders, healings) served as "signs of a true apostle" and authenticating marks of those bearing new revelation. Hebrews 2:3-4 explicitly links the confirmation of the gospel "by signs, wonders, various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit" with those who heard the Lord. With no new revelation to authenticate, these authenticating signs have fulfilled their purpose.

### 4. The History of Redemption Argument
God's pattern throughout Scripture is to cluster miraculous activity around critical epochs of redemptive history—Moses and the Exodus, Elijah and Elisha, Christ and the apostles. The apostolic age represented such an epoch, as God confirmed the New Covenant and established His church. The normal pattern of God's working between these epochs is through ordinary means.

### 5. The Testing and Abuse Problem
The New Testament contains strict instructions for testing prophecy (1 Thessalonians 5:19-21, 1 Corinthians 14:29) and regulating tongue-speaking, indicating potential for misuse. The contemporary charismatic movement demonstrates similar problems of false prophecies, unbiblical teachings, and emotional excess—consistent with what would be expected if these gifts were not genuinely operative.

## Scriptural Support

### Ephesians 2:19-20 (Foundation)
> "Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God's people and also members of his household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone."

### 1 Corinthians 13:8-10 (Ceasing of Gifts)
> "Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears."

### 2 Corinthians 12:12 (Apostolic Signs)
> "I persevered in demonstrating among you the marks of a true apostle, including signs, wonders and miracles."

### Hebrews 2:3-4 (Authentication of Revelation)
> "how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him. God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will."

### 1 Corinthians 14:21-22 (Tongues as Sign)
> "In the Law it is written: 'With other tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.' Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers..."

### 2 Timothy 3:16-17 (Sufficiency of Scripture)
> "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work."

### Jude 1:3 (Faith Once Delivered)
> "Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt compelled to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to God's holy people."

## Historical Context

Cessationism has deep roots in church history and became particularly articulated during the Reformation and post-Reformation periods:

- **Early Church Patterns**: While the early church witnessed miraculous activity, many church fathers (e.g., John Chrysostom, Augustine) noted the diminishing of miraculous gifts by their time, interpreting this as God's design.

- **Reformation Emphasis**: The Reformers strongly emphasized the sufficiency and final authority of Scripture (sola Scriptura), leading to skepticism of claims to new revelation through ongoing prophecy.

- **Calvin and Geneva**: John Calvin, while not a full cessationist by modern definitions, viewed extraordinary gifts as tied to the apostolic age and not normative for ongoing church life.

- **Princeton Theology**: 19th-century theologians like Charles Hodge and B.B. Warfield articulated detailed cessationist arguments, emphasizing the completed canon as the "perfect" of 1 Corinthians 13.

- **Modern Formulation**: Contemporary cessationism was refined in response to the Pentecostal movement (early 20th century) and the Charismatic movement (1960s-70s), with theologians like Richard Gaffin, John MacArthur, and Thomas Schreiner providing systematic defenses.

Today, cessationism is widely held among conservative Reformed and evangelical Christians, particularly in Presbyterian, Reformed Baptist, and some non-denominational contexts.

## Debate Style Guidance

### How to Argue This Position Charitably and Effectively

1. **Distinguish Positions Carefully**: Clarify what cessationism does and does not claim. Most cessationists do not deny God's ability to perform miracles today, only that He no longer gifts individuals with ongoing miraculous abilities. Many also affirm the continuation of non-sign gifts.

2. **Avoid Emotional Traps**: Do not ridicule or minimize the experiences of continuationist brothers and sisters in Christ. Many sincere believers have been profoundly helped in their faith through charismatic experiences. Focus on biblical interpretation rather than anecdotal evidence.

3. **Emphasize What We Hold in Common**: Affirm that both sides believe in the same God, the same gospel, and the same Spirit. The debate is about how God works, not whether He works.

4. **Lead with Scripture**: Begin with biblical texts and exegesis rather than starting with arguments about contemporary charismatic abuses. Let the Scripture drive the argument.

5. **Acknowledge Difficulties**: Be honest about challenging passages for cessationism (e.g., 1 Corinthians 14:39 "do not forbid speaking in tongues"). Address these texts directly and explain how cessationists interpret them.

6. **Distinguish Descriptive from Normative**: The Bible describes miraculous activity in the early church; the key question is whether this description establishes a normative pattern for all ages. Make this hermeneutical issue central.

7. **Focus on Theology, Not Personalities**: Avoid attacking specific continuationist leaders. Address theological arguments rather than individuals.

8. **Use the Analogy of Redemptive History**: Help frame the discussion by comparing apostolic miracles to other epochs of miraculous activity (Moses, Elijah) that were not intended to be normative for all time.

9. **Be Prepared to Discuss Suffering**: Cessationism's emphasis on ordinary means of grace relates to how God works through suffering. Be ready to discuss this pastoral dimension compassionately.

10. **Remember the Gospel is Central**: This is an important issue, but not a gospel issue. Maintain perspective that agreement on core doctrines matters most.

### Key Talking Points for Debate

- The foundation metaphor (Ephesians 2:20) implies a temporary, non-recurring role
- Sign gifts served authentication purposes tied to new revelation
- "The perfect" most naturally refers to completed revelation, not the second coming
- The pattern of redemptive history shows clustered miraculous activity
- The sufficiency of Scripture renders ongoing revelation unnecessary
- Contemporary charismatic abuses are consistent with inoperative gifts being falsely claimed
