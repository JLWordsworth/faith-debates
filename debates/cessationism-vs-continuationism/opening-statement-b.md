# Opening Statement - Continuationist Position

## The Continuationist Affirmation

I affirm that the spiritual gifts described in the New Testament—tongues, prophecy, healing, miracles, and the full range of charismatic endowments—remain available to Christ's church throughout the present age until our Lord returns. The Holy Spirit continues to distribute these gifts "to each one individually as He wills" (1 Corinthians 12:11) for the edification, exhortation, and comfort of the body of Christ. My position rests not on experience alone, but on what Scripture teaches about the Spirit's ongoing work, the timing of gifts' cessation, and God's unchanging character.

## Biblical Foundations for Continuationism

The exegetical foundation of continuationism begins with Paul's teaching in 1 Corinthians 13:8-12. There, the Apostle states that prophecies, tongues, and knowledge will cease "when the perfect comes." The immediate context reveals what "the perfect" (*to teleion*) signifies: Paul contrasts seeing "but a faint reflection as in a mirror" with seeing "face to face," and knowing "in part" with knowing "fully, even as I am fully known." This language echoes 1 John 3:2—"we shall see Him as He is"—pointing unmistakably to the eschatological consummation at Christ's return, not to the completion of the New Testament canon. The "partial" gives way to the "perfect" when we see our Lord face to face, not when the last biblical book was written.

Consider also Pentecost's significance. When the Spirit was poured out at Acts 2, Peter declared this the fulfillment of Joel's prophecy: "In the last days I will pour out My Spirit" (Acts 2:17). Joel's prophecy extends to "the day of the Lord" (Acts 2:20), indicating that the Spirit's charismatic work characterizes the entire church age, not merely a brief apostolic window. Peter explicitly extends Pentecost's promise: "This promise belongs to you and your children and to all who are far off—to all whom the Lord our God will call to Himself" (Acts 2:39). The "last days" began at Pentecost and continue until Christ's return.

## The Absence of Cessation Teaching

Perhaps the most significant argument for continuationism is what Scripture does *not* say. The New Testament contains extensive instructions for the proper exercise of tongues (1 Corinthians 14), prophecy (1 Corinthians 14:29-33), and other charismatic gifts. Paul commands believers to "earnestly desire spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy" (1 Corinthians 14:1) and explicitly instructs, "do not forbid speaking in tongues" (1 Corinthians 14:39). These directives would be perplexing, if not misleading, if these gifts were imminently to cease. When Paul instructs the Thessalonians, "Do not treat prophecies with contempt, but test all things; hold fast to what is good" (1 Thessalonians 5:20-21), he assumes ongoing prophetic activity requiring discernment, not rejection.

## God's Unchanging Character

Continuationism also flows from the biblical doctrine of God's immutability. Malachi 3:6 declares, "I the LORD do not change," and Hebrews 13:8 affirms that "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever." If God authenticated the gospel through signs, wonders, and gifts of the Holy Spirit in the first century (Hebrews 2:4), on what biblical basis do we conclude He no longer does so? The gospel's need for authentication has not diminished; the scope of the Great Commission remains "all nations"; and the Spirit's power is not depleted by time or geography.

## A Preview of Arguments to Come

In this debate, I will develop several lines of evidence. First, I will demonstrate that the New Testament portrays spiritual gifts as distributed among ordinary believers throughout the church, not limited to apostles. Second, I will show that the cessationist reading of 1 Corinthians 13:10 cannot withstand contextual and linguistic scrutiny. Third, I will address the theological problems inherent in claiming a major shift in God's operations without explicit biblical warrant. Fourth, I will acknowledge real abuses in charismatic circles while arguing that the biblical solution to counterfeits is discernment (1 John 4:1), not blanket rejection of all charismatic phenomena.

I recognize that my cessationist brothers and sisters genuinely seek to honor God's Word and protect His church from error. We share a commitment to Scripture's authority and to pursuing the truth wherever it leads. My prayer is that this discussion will be edifying, Scripture-saturated, and oriented toward the unity Christ desires for His people.
