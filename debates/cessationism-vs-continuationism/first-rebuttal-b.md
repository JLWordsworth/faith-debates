# First Rebuttal - Position B: Continuationism

I appreciate my brother's charitable opening statement and his clear articulation of the cessationist position. We share much common ground: a high view of Scripture, confidence in God's sovereignty, and a desire to protect the church from error. However, I must respectfully contend that the cessationist case rests on interpretations that require reading more into the text than Scripture itself teaches.

Regarding Ephesians 2:20, my opponent argues that apostles and prophets as a "foundation" implies their offices—and accompanying gifts—were temporary. Yet this inference requires assumptions beyond what the text states. The foundation metaphor indeed indicates these offices played a unique role in establishing the church, but nothing in Ephesians 2 suggests that all prophetic activity would cease once the foundation was laid. To the contrary, Ephesians 4:11-13 states that Christ gave "apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers" explicitly "until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ." The maturity described here has not yet been achieved, suggesting these offices may yet have a role. Furthermore, if the presence of apostles and prophets in the foundation proves their gifts ceased, we must ask: does the cessationist believe evangelists also ceased? They are listed alongside apostles and prophets in the same passage.

On 1 Corinthians 13:8-12, my opponent identifies "the perfect" (to teleion) with the completed canon. This interpretation faces significant exegetical challenges. First, the immediate context contrasts the "partial" (ek merous) with "face-to-face" vision—a metaphor for direct, unmediated encounter. Paul describes seeing "but a poor reflection as in a mirror" and then seeing "face to face." The mirror-to-face transition parallels 1 John 3:2: "we shall see him as he is." This eschatological vision occurs at Christ's return, not at canon completion. Second, Paul writes that he will "know fully, even as I am fully known." Does the completed canon provide this kind of comprehensive knowledge? Surely not—Scripture itself acknowledges that much remains mystery until Christ returns (1 Corinthians 13:12). Third, the canon-completion view requires Paul to instruct the Corinthians to eagerly desire gifts that were about to become obsolete—a curious instruction if their cessation was imminent. Why command the church to "eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially prophecy" (1 Corinthians 14:1) and "not forbid speaking in tongues" (1 Corinthians 14:39) if these gifts were about to permanently cease?

The authentication argument—that sign gifts confirmed apostles and new revelation—merits consideration but requires careful qualification. While it is true that miracles accompanied apostolic ministry (2 Corinthians 12:12; Hebrews 2:4), Scripture does not teach that miracles exclusively authenticated apostles. Jesus promised that "signs will accompany those who believe" (Mark 16:17), not merely apostles. Philip the evangelist, not an apostle, performed signs and wonders in Samaria (Acts 8:6-7). The gifts in 1 Corinthians 12-14 are distributed to "each one individually as the Spirit wills" (1 Corinthians 12:11) among the Corinthian believers—not apostles. If authentication was the sole purpose of sign gifts, why distribute them so broadly among ordinary believers? Moreover, the premise that the gospel no longer requires authentication assumes the completion of the canon itself provides all necessary authentication. Yet Scripture itself is not self-authenticating to those outside the faith; it is the Spirit's work—and yes, sometimes signs accompanying that work—that testifies to Christ's reality, particularly in cultures where the gospel is new.

My opponent also notes God's pattern of clustering miracles around redemptive epochs. This observation has merit, but it does not establish the cessation of gifts. Rather, it suggests God may work more overtly at certain times. However, the church age itself is a unique redemptive epoch, and Joel's prophecy—cited by Peter at Pentecost—explicitly places Spirit outpouring, including dreams, visions, and prophecy, throughout the "last days" leading up to "the day of the Lord" (Acts 2:17-21). Peter's declaration that Pentecost fulfilled Joel, with ongoing application ("this promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off"), suggests the charismatic dimension extends through the entire church age, not merely the apostolic period.

I appreciate my brother's acknowledgment that cessationism does not deny God's ability to work miraculously. Yet I must press this point: if God can and does perform miracles today, why would He never choose to distribute gifts for such works through Spirit-empowered believers? The cessationist position effectively creates a categorical restriction where Scripture provides none—a restriction that, ironically, requires a kind of extra-biblical revelation to establish.

The pastoral concerns about charismatic abuses are legitimate and must be addressed. But the biblical solution to counterfeit gifts is not to deny all gifts; it is discernment (1 Thessalonians 5:19-21; 1 John 4:1). We do not reject teaching because of false teachers, nor pastoral authority because of abusive pastors. We test all things and hold fast to what is good. The same principle applies to spiritual gifts.

In closing, I remain unpersuaded that Scripture teaches the cessation of any spiritual gifts before Christ's return. The "perfect" has not yet come, and until it does, the Spirit distributes gifts as He wills for the edification of Christ's church.
