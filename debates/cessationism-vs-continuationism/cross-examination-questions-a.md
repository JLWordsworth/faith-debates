# Cross-Examination Questions - Position A: Cessationism

## Question 1

You argue that contemporary prophecy must be "weighed" and "tested" by the church because it is subordinate to Scripture, yet you also maintain that the Spirit continues to give revelatory gifts. Given that New Testament prophecy carried binding authority (e.g., Agabus's prediction in Acts 21:11, the Corinthian prophecies in 1 Corinthians 14), how do you categorically distinguish genuine contemporary prophecies from authoritative Scripture without effectively creating a two-tier revelation system—one infallible, one fallible—when the New Testament itself provides no such category?

## Question 2

You maintain that "the perfect" in 1 Corinthians 13:10 refers to Christ's return rather than the completed canon, but this creates a significant difficulty: if the "partial" revelations of prophecy and tongues continue until the eschaton, what status does the completed canon have in your theology? Specifically, if prophetic utterances provide ongoing Spirit-given guidance that must be "tested" but may contain genuine divine revelation, how do you avoid the practical implication that Scripture is insufficient for the church's guidance and decision-making?

## Question 3

You argue that God's character does not change and that His desire to demonstrate power through His people remains constant, implying that the authentication of the gospel through signs and wonders is needed in every age. However, Hebrews 2:3-4 explicitly links this authentication to "those who heard him"—the apostles. If miraculous sign gifts serve the same authenticating purpose today as in the first century, why do we not see the same quality and frequency of miracles demonstrated in Scripture (e.g., raising the dead, instant healings of verifiable conditions), and what criteria do you use to distinguish genuine contemporary miracles from the well-documented fraud and psychosomatic effects common in charismatic circles?
