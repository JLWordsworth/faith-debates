# Cross-Examination Answers - Position A: Cessationism

## Response to Question 1

You ask how I distinguish genuine contemporary prophecies from authoritative Scripture without creating a two-tier revelation system. My answer begins with the observation that your question presupposes what cessationism denies: that contemporary prophetic utterances constitute genuine divine revelation. The cessationist position holds that the New Testament gift of prophecy has, in fact, ceased. What some call "prophecy" today does not belong to the same category as New Testament prophecy.

However, let me address your theological concern directly. Even during the apostolic era, there was a distinction between the prophet's spoken word and written Scripture. Paul instructs that prophecies must be "weighed" (1 Corinthians 14:29) and "tested" (1 Thessalonians 5:20-21). This indicates that even then, prophetic utterances were subordinate to Scripture and subject to evaluation. Your concern about a "two-tier" system is valid, but it cuts against continuationism: if prophecy continues today as genuine revelation that must be "tested" but may contain divine truth, you have indeed created precisely such a system. Cessationism avoids this problem by affirming that God's revelation is now complete in Scripture alone, with no additional prophetic utterances to be evaluated.

## Response to Question 2

You contend that "the perfect" in 1 Corinthians 13:10 refers to Christ's return, and you ask what status the completed canon has if "partial" revelations continue until the eschaton. This gets to the heart of our hermeneutical disagreement. Let me explain why the cessationist reading of this passage is more compelling.

Contextually, Paul is discussing prophecy and knowledge—specifically revelatory gifts. He contrasts the "partial" (*ek merous*) nature of these gifts with "the perfect" (*to teleion*). The term *teleion* means "complete" or "mature." What would complete or bring to maturity the partial revelations given through prophecy? The completion of God's revelation—the full canon of Scripture. Paul's use of "mirror" imagery supports this: in his day, mirrors provided a dim or partial reflection; today, in Scripture, we have a far clearer picture of God's truth. The "face to face" language, while echoing eschatological hope, also signifies the clarity that comes through complete revelation rather than partial glimpses.

You ask what status the canon has if partial revelations continue. This is precisely my concern about continuationism: if ongoing prophetic utterances provide Spirit-given guidance that must be tested but may contain divine truth, you implicitly deny the sufficiency of Scripture. The canon becomes insufficient for the church's guidance, requiring supplementation through contemporary prophecy. Cessationism affirms what 2 Timothy 3:16-17 teaches: that Scripture thoroughly equips God's people for every good work.

## Response to Question 3

You press the authentication argument, noting that Hebrews 2:3-4 links sign gifts to "those who heard him"—the apostles—and asking why we don't see the same quality of miracles today. This question actually supports the cessationist position.

The absence of comparable miracles today is not an accident; it is precisely what cessationism predicts. If sign gifts served primarily to authenticate apostolic messengers and new revelation—and that authentication has been completed—then we should not expect these gifts to continue. The question is not why cessationists don't perform miracles like the apostles; the question is why continuationists, who claim these gifts continue, cannot demonstrate miracles of apostolic quality.

You ask for criteria to distinguish genuine miracles from fraud and psychosomatic effects. Cessationism provides a clear criterion: apostolic-quality miracles—raising the dead, instant healings of verifiable medical conditions, creative healings (restoring missing limbs or organs)—are not occurring today. What we see instead are subjective experiences, psychosomatic improvements, and claims that cannot be verified. This is entirely consistent with what we would expect if sign gifts had ceased and what remains are either natural phenomena, psychological effects, or fraudulent claims.

Your reference to "well-documented fraud" in charismatic circles underscores the problem. When genuine gifts operate, counterfeits may exist. But when genuine gifts have ceased, all claims will necessarily be counterfeit, exaggerated, or misinterpreted natural phenomena. The prevalence of fraud and excess in continuationist movements is not an accidental abuse; it is the predictable result of claiming gifts that God is no longer giving.

**In Summary**: The cross-examination questions highlight a key difference between our positions. Cessationism maintains a consistent view of Scripture's sufficiency and completeness, while continuationism necessarily creates a tiered system of revelation. The cessationist position explains why we don't see apostolic-quality miracles today, whereas continuationism must explain their absence despite claiming the gifts continue.
