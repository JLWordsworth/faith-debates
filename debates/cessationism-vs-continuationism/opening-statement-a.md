# Opening Statement - Position A: Cessationism

## The Cessationist Position

I represent the position known as cessationism—the view that certain spiritual gifts, specifically the sign gifts such as tongues, prophecy, and miraculous healings, ceased with the close of the apostolic era and the completion of the New Testament canon. Let me be clear at the outset: cessationism does not deny God's ability to perform miracles today. Our God is sovereign and can intervene supernaturally at His pleasure. Rather, cessationism teaches that God no longer gifts individuals with ongoing miraculous abilities as normative practice in the church. The sign gifts served a unique, temporary purpose in redemptive history, and that purpose having been fulfilled, these gifts are no longer operative.

## Biblical Foundations

The cessationist position rests upon several pillars of Scripture. First, Ephesians 2:19-20 teaches that the church is "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the cornerstone." A foundation is laid once—it is not perpetually re-laid. Apostles and prophets were uniquely endowed with revelatory and sign gifts to establish this foundation. Once the foundation was complete, their distinctive office and accompanying gifts were no longer needed. This architectural metaphor speaks directly to the temporary nature of these offices.

Second, 1 Corinthians 13:8-12 provides crucial insight: "Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears." Paul contrasts the "partial" (ek merous) prophetic revelations of his day with "the perfect" (to teleion)—the complete. The question before us is: what constitutes "the perfect"? The most natural reading, given the context of revelation and prophecy, is that "the perfect" refers to the completed canon of Scripture. Once God's full revelation was complete, the partial revelatory gifts were no longer necessary.

Third, the sign gifts served an authenticating function. In 2 Corinthians 12:12, Paul states that he persevered in demonstrating "the marks of a true apostle, including signs, wonders and miracles." Similarly, Hebrews 2:3-4 explicitly links the confirmation of the gospel "by signs, wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit" with those who heard the Lord. Sign gifts authenticated new revelation and confirmed apostolic messengers. With no new revelation to authenticate, these authenticating signs have fulfilled their purpose.

## Preview of Key Arguments

In the course of this debate, I will develop several lines of argument. First, I will show that God's pattern throughout Scripture is to cluster miraculous activity around critical epochs of redemptive history—Moses and the Exodus, Elijah and Elisha, Christ and the apostles. The apostolic age represented such an epoch, as God confirmed the New Covenant and established His church. Between these epochs, God's normal mode of operation is through ordinary means.

Second, I will address the sufficiency of Scripture. As 2 Timothy 3:16-17 teaches, Scripture thoroughly equips God's servants "for every good work." Jude 1:3 speaks of "the faith that was once for all entrusted to God's holy people." The canon is complete, and God now speaks to His people through His written Word rather than through additional prophetic utterances.

Third, I will engage the practical and pastoral dimensions of this question. The New Testament contains strict instructions for testing prophecy and regulating tongue-speaking, acknowledging the potential for misuse. The contemporary charismatic movement demonstrates significant problems of false prophecies, unbiblical teachings, and emotional excess—difficulties that are entirely consistent with what we would expect if inoperative gifts were being falsely claimed.

I look forward to a charitable and Scripture-saturated discussion on this important topic. My brother in Christ and I both serve the same Lord, believe the same gospel, and are indwelt by the same Spirit. Our disagreement concerns how God works, not whether He works. May our conversation reflect that unity even as we explore our differences.
