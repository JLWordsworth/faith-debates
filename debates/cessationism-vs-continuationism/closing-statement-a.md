# Closing Statement - Position A: Cessationism

As we bring this debate to a close, I want to express my gratitude for this opportunity to discuss an important topic with a brother in Christ. We have explored many passages of Scripture and examined significant theological questions. In these closing remarks, I want to summarize the cessationist case and reflect on what is at stake.

## The Cessationist Case Summarized

The cessationist position rests on a consistent pattern evident throughout Scripture: God clusters miraculous activity around critical epochs of redemptive history, then works through ordinary means between those epochs. We see this with Moses and the Exodus, with Elijah and Elisha, supremely with Christ and the apostles, and then a return to ordinary means. This pattern suggests that the extraordinary gifts of the apostolic era served a unique purpose: authenticating new revelation and establishing the church's foundation.

Ephesians 2:19-20 presents the church as "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the cornerstone." A foundation is laid once. When the foundation is complete, the unique offices that established it are no longer needed. The sign gifts associated with apostolic ministry—miracles, healings, tongues—served as "signs of a true apostle" (2 Corinthians 12:12). With no new revelation to authenticate and the foundation complete, these gifts have fulfilled their purpose.

## The Sufficiency of Scripture

Perhaps most significantly, cessationism affirms what Scripture teaches about its own sufficiency. Second Timothy 3:16-17 declares that "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work." Jude 1:3 speaks of "the faith that was once for all entrusted to God's holy people." The canon is complete.

If ongoing prophetic utterances provide Spirit-given guidance that must be tested but may contain divine truth, what does this say about Scripture's sufficiency? The implication is that Scripture alone is not enough—that the church needs ongoing supplementary revelation. Cessationism maintains that God's Word is complete and sufficient for all of faith and practice.

## The Charismatic Phenomenon Today

My continuationist brother acknowledges real problems in charismatic circles—false prophecies, unbiblical teachings, emotional excess, financial exploitation. These are not peripheral issues; they are pervasive and persistent. Cessationism explains this phenomenon: when gifts have ceased, all claims will necessarily be counterfeit or misinterpreted. What we see today—subjective experiences that cannot be verified, psychosomatic improvements attributed to healing, claims that cannot be substantiated—is exactly what we would expect if sign gifts were no longer operative.

Continuationism faces a difficult question: if these gifts continue, why don't we see miracles of apostolic quality? Where are the raisings of the dead? Where are the creative healings—restoring missing limbs or organs? Where are the instantly verifiable healings of documented medical conditions? The absence of such miracles is not accidental; it is evidence that these gifts have ceased.

## What Is At Stake

This debate is not about whether God can perform miracles today. He is sovereign and can intervene supernaturally according to His will. Nor is this debate about the salvation of those who disagree. Both cessationists and continuationists can be genuine believers who love Christ and His Word.

What is at stake is the doctrine of Scripture. Does Scripture alone suffice, or does the church need ongoing supplementary revelation? Do we add to what God has said, or do we rest in the sufficiency of His completed Word? Cessationism calls us to a high view of Scripture—trusting that God has given us everything we need for life and godliness in His Word.

## Closing Reflections

I want to affirm again my respect for continuationist brothers and sisters in Christ. We share the same gospel, serve the same Lord, and are indwelt by the same Spirit. This is an important discussion, but it is not a primary doctrine. May we continue to explore these questions with charity, Scripture-saturated reasoning, and a desire to honor God above all.

The cessationist position invites us to rest in the sufficiency of Scripture, to trust that God has spoken fully and finally in His Word, and to pursue His will through the ordinary means of grace He has provided. May God be glorified in our discussions and in our lives.
