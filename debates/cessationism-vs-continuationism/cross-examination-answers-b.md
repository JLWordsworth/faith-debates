# Cross-Examination Answers - Position B: Continuationism

## Response to Question 1

You suggest that "the perfect" in 1 Corinthians 13:10 refers to the completed canon of Scripture, but you object that Paul uses language of "seeing face to face" and "knowing fully, even as I am fully known"—which you acknowledge strongly suggests eschatological vision of God. Your question actually reveals the weakness of the cessationist interpretation.

Let me respond directly. If Paul intended to point to the closing of the canon, why would he use language that throughout Scripture denotes direct, personal encounter with God? The "face to face" motif appears in Exodus 33:11 ("The LORD would speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks with his friend"), in the Aaronic blessing (Numbers 6:25-26, "the LORD make his face shine on you"), and repeatedly describes the beatific vision—the direct sight of God in glory. 1 John 3:2 uses parallel language: "we shall see him as he is." This is the consummation, not the canon.

You ask why Paul would use eschatological language if referring to the canon. This is precisely my argument: he wouldn't, and he didn't. The cessationist reading requires importing a theological construct (canon completion) into a passage whose natural reading points to Christ's return. The "mirror" imagery supports this: ancient mirrors provided reflections, but the reality comes when we see the object itself. The canon gives us a reflection; the consummation brings us face to face with Christ.

## Response to Question 2

You argue that sign gifts served primarily to authenticate apostolic messengers and new revelation, and you suggest that if authenticating signs were only needed in the apostolic era, this implies the gospel needs less supernatural confirmation today. This is an important question that deserves a thoughtful answer.

My response has two parts. First, I would question the premise that sign gifts served *primarily* to authenticate apostolic messengers. While this was certainly one function, the New Testament presents multiple purposes for spiritual gifts: edification (1 Corinthians 14:3-5), exhortation, comfort, the common good (1 Corinthians 12:7), and the demonstration of God's power to unbelievers (1 Corinthians 14:24-25). Authentication of apostles was one purpose among several, not the sole purpose.

Second, and more fundamentally, you're right that your position has implications—and I believe those implications are problematic. If the gospel needed supernatural confirmation through signs and wonders in the first century, what has changed? The gospel is the same. Human lostness is the same. The God we proclaim is the same. Why would He deem supernatural demonstration unnecessary now? The cessationist must argue that the gospel today requires less supernatural confirmation than in the first century, or that the church is somehow more capable of advancing it without such aid. Neither position has biblical warrant.

Scripture presents a God who consistently demonstrates His power in conjunction with gospel proclamation. From the plagues of Egypt to the miracles of Jesus to the signs of the early church, God has authenticated His message through supernatural demonstration. To suggest that this authentication is no longer needed is to say something significant—something the Bible never explicitly says—about how God operates in the world.

## Response to Question 3

You point to Ephesians 2:20, which identifies apostles and prophets as foundational, and you argue that the New Testament never explicitly states that the gifts associated with these offices would cease. You also note Paul's instructions to "eagerly desire spiritual gifts" and "do not forbid speaking in tongues." These are excellent questions that go to the heart of our hermeneutical differences.

Regarding Ephesians 2:20, the "foundation" imagery does indicate the unique, temporary role of apostles and prophets in establishing the church. However, cessationists must make a logical leap that the text does not: that the *offices* of apostle and prophet were temporary (which I grant) does not necessarily mean that all *gifts* associated with prophetic ministry ceased. Even if no new apostles exist, why couldn't God still give prophetic gifts to the church for edification? The text does not make this connection.

Your point about Paul's instructions is precisely why I find continuationism more compelling. Why would the Spirit inspire detailed regulation of gifts that were about to disappear from the church's experience? Consider what this would mean: in 1 Corinthians 12-14, Paul devotes an entire chapter to teaching about spiritual gifts, then gives extensive instructions on their proper use—all for gifts that would cease within a generation or two. This is not how we see Paul operating elsewhere. When he addresses temporary issues (circumcision, food sacrificed to idols), he identifies them as such. Here, he gives normative instruction for church practice without any hint that these gifts are temporary.

The most natural reading is that these gifts continue. The burden of proof rests on those claiming they ceased to demonstrate from Scripture that this is so. The fact that cessationism must argue from silence—that there is no explicit statement about cessation—is itself telling.

---

**In Summary**: The cross-examination reveals that continuationism offers a more natural reading of the biblical text. Paul's eschatological language in 1 Corinthians 13 points to Christ's return, not canon completion. The gospel's need for supernatural demonstration has not diminished. And Paul's detailed instructions for spiritual gifts would be inexplicable if these gifts were about to cease. Continuationism affirms what the text actually says, while cessationism must import theological constructs not explicit in Scripture.
