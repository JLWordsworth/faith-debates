# Closing Statement - Position B: Continuationism

I want to begin by expressing my appreciation for this conversation. Discussing spiritual gifts with a brother who loves Scripture and desires to honor God has been enriching, even where we disagree. As we conclude, I want to summarize the continuationist case and reflect on the heart of this matter.

## The Continuationist Case Summarized

The continuationist position rests on a straightforward reading of Scripture: unless the Bible explicitly teaches that a spiritual gift has ceased, we should not assume it has. The New Testament presents spiritual gifts as distributed by the Spirit "to each one individually as He wills" (1 Corinthians 12:11) for the edification of the body. Paul commands believers to "earnestly desire spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy" (1 Corinthians 14:1) and explicitly instructs, "do not forbid speaking in tongues" (1 Corinthians 14:39). These are not temporary regulations; they are normative instructions for the church.

The central cessationist argument—that "the perfect" in 1 Corinthians 13:10 refers to the completed canon—cannot withstand contextual scrutiny. Paul contrasts seeing "a faint reflection as in a mirror" with seeing "face to face" and knowing "in part" with knowing "fully, even as I am fully known." This is eschatological language pointing to Christ's return, not to the closing of the canon. The "partial" gives way to the "perfect" when we see our Lord face to face.

## The Silence About Cessation

Perhaps the most significant argument for continuationism is what Scripture does not say. The New Testament contains no explicit teaching that spiritual gifts would cease before Christ's return. None. Think about how significant this would be if it were true: God would cease giving gifts that He had distributed throughout the early church, gifts for which Paul provided detailed regulation, gifts that he commanded believers to eagerly desire. Would the Spirit not inspire some explicit teaching about this major change?

The cessationist must argue from silence—interpreting certain passages as implying cessation without any direct statement to that effect. This is a precarious hermeneutical approach. When Scripture speaks, we listen; when Scripture is silent, we should be cautious about teaching what God has not taught.

## God's Unchanging Character

Continuationism flows from the biblical doctrine of God's immutability. Malachi 3:6 declares, "I the LORD do not change," and Hebrews 13:8 affirms that "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever." The God who authenticated the gospel through signs, wonders, and gifts of the Holy Spirit in the first century (Hebrews 2:4) has not changed His methods or diminished His power.

My cessationist brother suggests that the gospel needed supernatural authentication then but not now. I find this unpersuasive. The gospel is the same. Human lostness is the same. The God we proclaim is the same. Why would He deem supernatural demonstration unnecessary? The burden of proof rests on those claiming a major shift in God's operations to demonstrate from Scripture that this is so.

## Proper Discernment, Not Dismissal

I acknowledge real problems in some continuationist circles. False prophecies, emotional excess, financial exploitation—these are real and must be addressed. But the biblical solution to counterfeit gifts is not to reject all gifts; it is to exercise discernment. Paul instructs, "Do not treat prophecies with contempt. Test all things. Hold fast to what is good" (1 Thessalonians 5:20-21). Testing implies the genuine exists alongside the counterfeit. You cannot test what doesn't exist; you would simply reject everything.

Cessationism, by contrast, cannot exercise discernment because it rejects all charismatic phenomena a priori. This is not the biblical approach. The biblical approach is to acknowledge that counterfeits exist—and the presence of counterfeits actually implies the existence of the genuine—while testing everything and holding fast to what is good.

## What Is At Stake

This debate is not about the core of the gospel. Both cessationists and continuationists can be genuine believers who love Christ and His Word. But something important is at stake: our view of how God works in the world. Does the Spirit still distribute gifts as He wills? Does God still demonstrate His power through His people? Is the church today called to manifest the Spirit's presence in all the ways described in Scripture?

Continuationism says yes. The Spirit who worked powerfully in the early church still works powerfully today. The gifts that edified the body then still edify the body now. The God who revealed His power through signs and wonders has not changed.

## Closing Reflections

I want to reaffirm my respect for cessationist brothers and sisters in Christ. We serve the same Lord, believe the same gospel, and are indwelt by the same Spirit. This is an important discussion, but not a primary doctrine. May we continue to explore these questions with charity, Scripture-saturated reasoning, and a desire to honor God above all.

The continuationist position invites us to expect more from God—not more than Scripture promises, but all that Scripture promises. It calls us to pursue the Spirit's fullness, to earnestly desire spiritual gifts, and to trust that the Spirit who worked mightily in the early church still works mightily today. May God be glorified in our discussions and in our lives.
