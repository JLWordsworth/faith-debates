# Second Rebuttal - Position A: Cessationism

I am grateful for my opponent's thoughtful engagement and charitable tone. We continue to find common ground in our commitment to Scripture and the Spirit's work. In this response, I will address the key challenges raised against the cessationist position.

## Ephesians 4:11-13 and the "Until" Clause

My opponent presses Ephesians 4:11-13, arguing that Christ gave apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers "until we all reach unity in the faith" and attain maturity—conditions not yet fully realized, suggesting these offices may continue. This argument deserves careful attention.

However, the "until" (*mechri*) in Ephesians 4:13 need not imply the perpetual operation of all listed offices. It specifies the duration of their collective function: building up the body "until" the church reaches mature stature. The crucial question is whether each office has the same duration. Ephesians 2:20 explicitly identifies apostles and prophets as the foundation—a distinctive role by nature temporary. The transition from foundation to superstructure does not require the ongoing presence of those who laid it. By contrast, pastors and teachers are not called foundational but are given for ongoing equipping (Ephesians 4:12). The cessationist distinguishes between foundational and edificatory offices, allowing the latter to continue while the former have fulfilled their unique purpose.

As for evangelists, the cessationist position does not claim their cessation. Philip the evangelist (Acts 21:8) was not an apostle, and his office was not tied to sign gifts or new revelation. The continuationist argument here equivocates between distinct offices. Apostles and prophets were uniquely endowed with revelatory gifts and foundational authority; evangelists were not.

## 1 Corinthians 13:8-12 and the Nature of "Face-to-Face"

My opponent argues that the "face-to-face" vision of 1 Corinthians 13:12 parallels 1 John 3:2 and thus refers to seeing Christ at His return. This comparison requires scrutiny. In 1 John 3:2, "seeing Him as He is" indeed describes the eschatological vision. But in 1 Corinthians 13, Paul contrasts knowing "in part" (*ek merous*) with knowing "as I am fully known." The "part" refers to the partial revelations of prophecy and tongues—gifts that conveyed revelation piece by piece. The contrast is between partial and complete revelation, not between present ignorance and future beatific vision.

Furthermore, if "the perfect" refers to Christ's return, then Paul's statement that prophecies will "cease" (*pausontai*) and tongues "will pass away" (*katargeēsontai*) at that point is uncontroversial—both sides agree gifts cease then. The cessationist makes the more specific claim: that revelatory gifts ceased when the canon was complete, rendering them no longer necessary. The continuationist interpretation provides no account for when, if ever, these gifts might cease before Christ's return. Must prophecy continue until the parousia? If so, what status do contemporary prophecies have relative to Scripture? Are they on par with biblical prophecy, or something less? The continuationist position faces difficult questions here that cessationism answers cleanly.

## The Breadth of Sign Gift Distribution

My opponent argues that if sign gifts served only apostolic authentication, why were they distributed broadly among ordinary believers (1 Corinthians 12:11)? This is an excellent question that reveals an important nuance in the cessationist position. The authentication argument does not claim that only apostles performed miracles. Rather, it claims that sign gifts served to authenticate the apostolic message and the New Covenant revelation—not merely apostles as individuals. The Corinthians' gifts authenticated Paul's apostolic ministry among them and confirmed the gospel he preached.

Moreover, the continuationist argument from breadth of distribution actually cuts against their position. If sign gifts were meant to be normative for the entire church age, why were they clustered so heavily in the apostolic period and largely absent in the immediate post-apostolic era? The writings of the Apostolic Fathers (Clement of Rome, Ignatius, Polycarp) show no expectation of ongoing miraculous gifts, despite facing intense persecution that would seemingly warrant them. This historical pattern is more consistent with a temporary, foundational role than with permanent normativity.

## The "Extra-Biblical Revelation" Charge

My opponent suggests that cessationism requires "extra-biblical revelation" to establish its categorical restriction. I must respectfully disagree. Cessationism is an inference drawn from Scripture itself—from Ephesians 2:20, 1 Corinthians 13:8-12, Hebrews 2:3-4, and the pattern of redemptive history. It requires no extra-biblical authority, only careful biblical interpretation and synthesis.

By contrast, the continuationist position faces a more serious challenge: if contemporary prophecy provides genuine revelation from God, how does it relate to the completed canon? Is it supplementary? Subordinate? Fallible? The New Testament knows nothing of "fallible prophecy"—prophets spoke God's words with authority. To claim ongoing prophecy while maintaining biblical authority requires a category not found in Scripture: non-authoritative revelation. This position has more explaining to do.

## Conclusion

The cessationist case remains robust: foundational offices fulfilled their temporary purpose; the canon's completion rendered revelatory gifts unnecessary; the pattern of redemptive history shows clustered miracles around epochal events; and the sufficiency of Scripture provides God's people with all they need for life and godliness. We do not deny God's power to work miraculously, only His choice to distribute such gifts through individuals as normative church practice. This position honors Scripture, reflects redemptive history, and protects the church from confusion and error.
