# Cross-Examination Questions - Position B: Continuationism

## Question 1

You argue that "the perfect" in 1 Corinthians 13:10 refers to the completed canon of Scripture, rendering revelatory gifts unnecessary. However, Paul contrasts "that which is partial" with "seeing face to face" and "knowing fully, even as I am fully known"—language that strongly suggests the eschatological vision of God (cf. 1 John 3:2). If Paul intended to point his readers toward the closing of the canon, why did he use language that throughout Scripture denotes direct encounter with God Himself rather than a completed text?

## Question 2

You contend that sign gifts served primarily to authenticate apostolic messengers and new revelation. Yet if authenticating signs were only needed during the apostolic era, does this imply that the gospel today requires less supernatural confirmation than it did in the first century? If God deemed miracles necessary to demonstrate the truth of the gospel then, what scriptural warrant suggests that unbelievers in our age have become less in need of such demonstration—or that the church has become more capable of advancing the gospel without such aid?

## Question 3

Cessationism asserts that Ephesians 2:20 identifies apostles and prophets as foundational, implying their temporary role. Yet the New Testament never explicitly states that the gifts associated with these offices would cease. Given that Paul instructs believers to "eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy" (1 Corinthians 14:1) and commands "do not forbid speaking in tongues" (1 Corinthians 14:39)—instruction to the Corinthians, not merely to the apostles—why would the Spirit inspire such detailed regulation of gifts that were about to disappear from the church's experience, and why is there no explicit teaching that these gifts would cease before Christ's return?
