# First Rebuttal - Cessationist Position

I appreciate my opponent's gracious and Scripture-focused opening statement. We agree on much: the Holy Spirit's ongoing work in the church, God's power to perform miracles, and the need for discernment regarding spiritual gifts. The question before us is not whether God is powerful, but how He has chosen to distribute that power throughout redemptive history.

## The "Perfect" of 1 Corinthians 13: Contextual Considerations

My opponent argues that "the perfect" (*to teleion*) in 1 Corinthians 13:10 refers to Christ's return rather than canon completion. While I acknowledge this is a common interpretation, several contextual factors favor the canonical view. First, Paul contrasts what is "in part" (*ek merous*) with "the perfect." What exists "in part" in this context? Prophecies, tongues, and knowledge—gifts that involve revelation. The contrast is between partial revelation and complete revelation, not between partial sanctification and glorification.

Second, Paul's mirror analogy in verses 11-12, when read in its historical context, actually supports the cessationist reading. First-century mirrors gave imperfect reflections compared to seeing directly. But Paul doesn't say "we see but a poor reflection now; we shall see face to face at the resurrection." He says we shall see "face to face" when "the perfect comes." This fits the transition from the apostolic era's partial revelations to the completed New Testament, where we now see Christ "face to face" in the fullness of revealed truth.

Third, if "the perfect" refers to Christ's return, then cessationists and continuationists agree—gifts will cease then. The cessationist claim is more specific: that revelatory gifts ceased when their purpose (establishing the church's foundation) was complete. My opponent has not engaged Ephesians 2:20, which describes apostles and prophets as the church's foundation—a role by definition temporary.

## Pentecost, Joel, and the "Last Days"

My opponent rightly notes that Peter cited Joel 2 at Pentecost, declaring "this is what was spoken" (Acts 2:16). But Joel's prophecy contains elements not yet fulfilled, such as cosmic wonders preceding "the day of the Lord" (Acts 2:19-20). Peter is not saying Pentecost exhaustively fulfills Joel; rather, he identifies Pentecost as the beginning of the fulfillment that will culminate at Christ's return. The "last days" began at Pentecost and continue until Christ's return—but this does not require that all first-century phenomena characterize the entire period.

Consider the parallel with the Exodus. God performed miracles through Moses to establish the Old Covenant and redeem Israel. This was an epoch of redemptive-historical significance. No one argues that every generation should expect Red Sea crossings or manna from heaven. The apostolic age was the New Covenant's founding epoch, with corresponding miraculous activity. This pattern—clustering miracles around epochal redemptive events—is consistent throughout Scripture and poses no challenge to God's immutability. God changes not, but His methods do vary across redemptive history.

## The Argument from Silence Reconsidered

My opponent contends that the absence of explicit cessation teaching is a significant argument for continuationism. But this argument from silence cuts both ways. Where does the New Testament explicitly teach that all spiritual gifts will continue until Christ's return? Where do we find instructions for how future generations should recognize apostles or test new revelation? The silence on these points is deafening if we assume all first-century phenomena were normative for all time.

Moreover, my opponent notes Paul's instruction "do not forbid speaking in tongues" (1 Corinthians 14:39) as evidence for continuation. But this command was given to a Corinthian church where tongues were actually occurring and causing disorder. Paul is regulating a current practice, not mandating its perpetual continuation. Similarly, his command to "earnestly desire spiritual gifts" assumes the gifts' operation in his audience's context—not necessarily in every age.

The fact that the New Testament contains extensive regulation of charismatic gifts actually supports cessationism. If these gifts were meant to continue normatively, why do we find no instructions beyond the apostolic era for how to recognize authentic apostles, distinguish true from false prophecy, or integrate new revelation with existing revelation? The New Testament's regulatory framework assumes the presence of apostolic authority—an authority that ceased with the apostles' death.

## God's Character and the Sufficiency of Scripture

My opponent appeals to God's immutability, arguing that a God who authenticated the gospel with signs in the first century would surely continue doing so. But this assumes that the purpose of signs was ongoing gospel authentication rather than the specific authentication of apostolic revelation. Hebrews 2:3-4 links signs and wonders specifically to "those who heard Him"—the apostles. The gospel needs no new authentication; it was once for all "confirmed to us."

What better reflects God's character: that He continually provides new revelations and signs, or that He has given His people a complete and sufficient Word? The sufficiency of Scripture (2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:3-4) is a profound expression of God's generosity and care. He has not left His people dependent on ongoing revelation, but has provided "everything we need for a godly life" in His completed Word.

I look forward to further developing these themes and addressing my opponent's additional arguments as this dialogue continues.
