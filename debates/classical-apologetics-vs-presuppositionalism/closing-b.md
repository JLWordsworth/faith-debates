# Closing Statement - Presuppositionalism

As this debate concludes, I want to express my appreciation for my opponent's thoughtful defense of classical apologetics. His sincerity, commitment to Scripture, and desire to defend the faith are evident throughout. The classical tradition has produced many faithful defenders of the gospel, and I honor that legacy. We agree on far more than we disagree: the truth of Christianity, the authority of Scripture, the necessity of the Spirit's work, and the urgency of proclaiming Christ to a lost world.

However, the differences between our approaches are not merely methodological preferences but go to the heart of how we understand human reasoning, the nature of unbelief, and the authority of God's Word. My opponent's approach assumes that believers and unbelievers can reason together from shared premises on neutral ground. Scripture teaches otherwise. Romans 8:7 tells us that "the mind of the flesh is hostile to God: It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so." 1 Corinthians 2:14 reminds us that "the natural man does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God. For they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned." Unbelief is not merely lack of information but moral rebellion that suppresses known truth (Romans 1:18-21). Treating unbelief as if it were neutral intellectual deficiency misdiagnoses the problem and therefore misapplies the cure.

My opponent appeals to biblical examples like Paul in Athens or Jesus before the high priest as evidence for "common ground" apologetics. But these examples, properly understood, support the presuppositional approach. Paul did not begin by proving theism from neutral evidence; he proclaimed the Creator God who "now commands all people everywhere to repent" (Acts 17:30). He exposed the Athenians' suppression of the truth they already knew, calling them to acknowledge the God they had been ignoring. Jesus before His accusers did not submit His authority to their autonomous judgment; He used internal critique to expose their hypocrisy, holding them accountable to standards they professed but violated. Both recognized that there is no neutral ground—Christ is Lord of all, and every thought must be taken captive to Him (2 Corinthians 10:5).

The classical approach also places human reason in the position of judge over God's Word. My opponent protests that this is a caricature, but consider his own formulation: "We do not judge Scripture by autonomous reason; we demonstrate that Scripture's claims are rationally defensible when evaluated by standards that Scripture itself presupposes." The question remains: Who determines whether Scripture is being "rationally defensible"? Who determines what Scripture "presupposes"? When human reason sits in judgment over whether Scripture meets rational standards—however those standards are defined—reason has been exalted above revelation. The self-attesting Word needs no external validation. As Romans 3:4 declares, "Let God be true and every man a liar."

The fundamental issue is the authority of autonomous human thought. The classical apologist wants to use reason as a neutral tool to demonstrate Christianity's truth. But reason is not neutral. All reasoning presupposes something about the nature of reality, knowledge, and logic. The question is not whether we will be circular, but which circle we will inhabit. The classical apologist's circle is unacknowledged—he presupposes Christian truths (the reliability of reason, the uniformity of nature, the validity of logic) while claiming to argue from neutral premises. This is borrowed capital. At least the presuppositionalist is honest about where we begin: with the self-attesting Word of God.

My opponent asks for "shared criteria" like explanatory power to adjudicate between worldviews. But this demand itself presupposes that truth can be adjudicated by neutral standards—that we can step outside our worldviews and compare them from some vantage point. This is impossible. All reasoning operates within a framework. Christianity is not one hypothesis among others to be evaluated by shared criteria; it is the necessary precondition for any criteria whatsoever. Without the Triune God of Scripture, there is no basis for logic, morality, science, or knowledge. The proof of Christianity is the impossibility of the contrary: if Christianity is false, nothing can be true, known, or meaningful.

I recognize that my opponent's approach has been used by God, and I rejoice whenever anyone comes to faith through whatever means God chooses. But I urge my opponent to consider: if unbelief is suppression of known truth rather than lack of evidence, if all reasoning depends on presuppositions that cannot be proved without circularity, and if the Holy Spirit's testimony through Scripture is necessary for persuasion—then why approach apologetics as if neutral ground existed? Let us instead stand boldly on the self-attesting Word of God, challenge the unbeliever's presuppositions, and show that only Christianity provides the foundation for the very reasoning they employ.

Presuppositionalism presents Christianity not as one probable hypothesis among many but as the necessary foundation for all hypotheses. It does not beg the question but exposes the question that every worldview must answer: What must be true for human reasoning, morality, science, and knowledge to be possible? Only the Christian God provides the answer. All other worldviews collapse under the weight of their own borrowed capital.

In the end, both approaches recognize that God's truth is the ultimate standard. The question is whether we will acknowledge Christ's Lordship over our reasoning from the start, or whether we will reason as if we could approach God's Word from a position of neutrality. As Colossians 2:8 warns, "See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, which are based on human tradition and the spiritual forces of the world rather than on Christ." All genuine wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ (Colossians 2:3). There is no neutral ground.
