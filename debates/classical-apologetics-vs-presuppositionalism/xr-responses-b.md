## Response to Question 1: Biblical Examples of Reasoned Argument

I appreciate my opponent's careful attention to Scripture. However, the examples cited do not contradict presuppositionalism when properly understood within their covenantal context.

**Elijah on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18)**: This event occurred during a covenant lawsuit against *apostate Israelites*—people who already knew Yahweh but were wavering between two opinions. Elijah's test was not an appeal to "neutral evidence" but a demonstration of Yahweh's exclusive covenant claim. Notice that Elijah did not say, "Let us examine the evidence and decide which god is most probable." He declared, "How long will you go limping between two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him" (1 Kings 18:21). This was a call to covenant faithfulness, not neutral inquiry. The fire from heaven was God's self-attestation, not a piece of evidence in a neutral evidentialist scheme. The Israelites already knew Yahweh; they needed to return to exclusive loyalty.

**Jesus before Annas and Caiaphas (John 18)**: Jesus' appeal to public testimony was not an acceptance of neutral criteria but an exposure of their hypocrisy. These were religious leaders who claimed to value truth and God's law. Jesus held them accountable to their own professed standards, showing their inconsistency. This aligns perfectly with Proverbs 26:5—"Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes." Jesus was not validating their autonomous reasoning; He was using internal critique to expose their bad faith. Furthermore, Jesus consistently taught that His authority was self-attesting and independent of human testimony (John 8:14: "Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid").

**Paul before Felix (Acts 24)**: Paul spoke of "righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment"—concepts that Felix, as a Roman steeped in Stoic-influenced culture, would recognize. But Paul was not building a case from "shared moral concepts" that both parties accepted as neutral. He was exposing Felix's suppressed knowledge of God. Notice Paul's consistent approach elsewhere: in Acts 17, he tells the Athenians that God "now commands all people everywhere to repent" (Acts 17:30)—not because the evidence demands it, but because God is their Creator and Judge. In Athens, Paul began by proclaiming the Creator God, not by establishing theism through neutral proofs.

The fundamental error here is assuming that using reasoned argument or appealing to experience requires accepting "neutral ground." Not at all. We can—and must—use reason, evidence, and argument, but we do so *within the framework of God's revelation*, not as autonomous judges sitting above Scripture. As Van Til said, we are not reasoning independently of God to God; we are reasoning from God's revelation to understanding His world.

## Response to Question 2: The Problem of First Contact

This question reveals a common misunderstanding. Let me be clear: I do not refuse to engage with atheists, nor do I begin by demanding they accept Scripture's authority before we talk. Rather, I begin by exposing the foundations of their own worldview.

My first move with an atheist who rejects the Bible's authority is to ask questions like these:

- "On what basis do you trust your reasoning faculties?"
- "How do you account for the existence of invariant logical laws in a materialistic universe?"
- "What foundation do you have for believing that nature will behave tomorrow as it does today?"
- "Why do you believe humans have inherent dignity and rights?"

The atheist will likely appeal to logic, science, and morality—but these are precisely the things their worldview cannot account for. I am not appealing to "neutral concepts we both accept"; I am showing that concepts the atheist *uses* are incoherent without Christian theism. There is a crucial difference: I am not saying, "Here is shared ground from which we can reason neutrally." I am saying, "You are using tools that only Christianity can justify—let me show you your borrowed capital."

This is not "common ground" in the classical apologetics sense of shared interpretive framework. It is what Van Til called "common ground by way of supplementation"—the unbeliever uses logic, morality, and science, but cannot account for them. We agree on the *reality* of these things, but we fundamentally disagree on their *foundation* and *interpretation*.

So my answer is not (a), (b), or (c) exactly, but rather: I engage the atheist by demonstrating that their worldview cannot provide the preconditions for the very reasoning they employ. I show them that they are living on Christian foundation while denying the Architect who built it. This is not conceding neutral ground; it is exposing the atheist's inconsistency.

## Response to Question 3: The Relationship Between Evidence and Presupposition

This question challenges me to provide a criterion for choosing between worldviews without appealing to "shared criteria." But this question itself assumes what it needs to prove—that there must be shared, neutral criteria for adjudicating worldviews.

Let me turn the question back: What is the basis for demanding "shared criteria" like explanatory power? This demand itself presupposes that truth can be adjudicated by neutral standards—that we can step outside our worldviews and compare them from some vantage point. But this is exactly what cannot be done. All reasoning operates within a framework.

However, this does not leave us in a position of bare assertion. Christianity is not arbitrary; it is demonstrated by the *impossibility of the contrary*. When I say that only Christianity can account for logic, morality, science, and knowledge, I am making a testable claim: Show me any non-Christian worldview that can provide the preconditions for these things without borrowing from Christian presuppositions.

The Muslim who claims Islam accounts for these things faces serious problems: Islam's god is not necessary, not triune, and not covenantally faithful in the same way. The Islamic concept of God cannot account for the uniformity of nature (since Allah's will is capricious) or for universal, invariant laws of logic (since logic is not grounded in Allah's nature). Similarly, naturalistic accounts of logic as "adaptive behavior" are self-defeating—they use logic to argue that logic is merely adaptive, undermining the very truth claim they're making.

So how do we adjudicate between worldviews? Not by appealing to neutral criteria, but by *internal critique*: Does the worldview cohere? Can it account for the preconditions of intelligibility? Does it collapse under its own weight? Christianity passes this test; other worldviews fail.

I am not caught in a dilemma. I do not appeal to shared criteria (which would concede neutral ground), nor do I rely on bare assertion. I demonstrate that the Christian worldview is the necessary precondition for rationality itself, and I show that every alternative worldview destroys the very tools it uses to argue against Christianity.

The criterion is not external to worldviews but internal: Does the worldview provide the foundation for the possibility of meaning, truth, and knowledge? Only Christianity does.
