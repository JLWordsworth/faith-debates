# Cross-Examination Responses - Debater A (Classical Apologetics)

## Response to Question 1: Neutral Ground and the Noetic Effects of Sin

Thank you for this important question. You are right to emphasize the noetic effects of sin, and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify my position.

I do not claim that unbelievers can reason *apart* from God's grace, nor do I treat unbelief as merely an intellectual problem. Rather, I affirm what Scripture teaches: that all humans retain the *imago Dei* (image of God) despite the fall. This includes rational faculties that, while fallen and impaired, remain sufficiently reliable to discern truth about God and the world.

Consider Genesis 8:21, where God says "every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood." Yet in the very same verse, God promises never to curse the ground again because "the intentions of man's heart are evil from his youth" (BSB). If human reason were so thoroughly corrupted as to make meaningful dialogue impossible, how could God hold humans accountable for suppressing the truth in Romans 1? You cannot suppress what you cannot recognize.

Romans 8:7 describes the *direction* of the unregenerate will—hostility toward God—not the *incapacity* to recognize truth. The unregenerate mind *can* know true things about God (as Romans 1:18-20 makes clear), but it *will not* submit to Him. The problem is volitional/moral, not merely epistemological.

When Paul engaged at the Areopagus (Acts 17), he did not first dismantle the philosophers' presuppositions. He affirmed their partial truths ("as some of your own poets have said") and built a case from those truths to the true God. This is precisely the classical approach: begin where people are, using language and concepts they understand, to build a bridge to the gospel.

This is not treating unbelief as merely intellectual. It is recognizing that God's common grace enables even those hostile to Him to recognize truth when it is presented clearly and compellingly. The Holy Spirit must ultimately bring conviction and regeneration, but He often works through the presentation of evidence and rational argument.

## Response to Question 2: The Final Authority—Reason or Revelation?

Your question identifies a genuine tension, but I believe you misunderstand the classical approach. Let me clarify.

Classical apologetics does not ask unbelievers to judge Scripture by autonomous reason. Rather, we demonstrate that Christian claims are *rationally defensible* when evaluated by standards that even unbelievers implicitly accept—standards like logic, evidence, and coherence.

The dilemma you present is false. Let me offer a third option:

**(3)** The unbeliever, despite their hostility to God and suppression of truth, still lives in God's world and uses God-given rational faculties to navigate reality. They cannot consistently escape the basic laws of logic, the uniformity of nature, or the reality of moral obligation. When we present evidence for Christianity, we are not asking them to adopt *autonomous* standards, but to recognize that the standards they *already use* in everyday life point compellingly to Christianity's truth.

You ask: "If the unbeliever rejects your evidence as insufficient, have they failed to meet an objective standard that exists independently of God's revelation, or have they simply exercised their autonomous reason contrary to God's Word?"

My answer: They have exercised their fallen, sin-affected reason contrary to God's Word *and* contrary to the evidence. But this does not make their reasoning the final authority. The final authority is God's revelation; evidence and reason are the *means* by which we demonstrate that revelation's credibility.

Consider Jesus' response to Thomas (John 20:27). Thomas demanded evidence; Jesus provided it. Was Jesus making Thomas' autonomous reason the final judge? No. Jesus accommodated Thomas' doubt by providing the evidence he needed, then pronounced blessing on those who believe without seeing (John 20:29). Evidence does not replace faith; it supports faith.

Similarly, when Paul presented evidence for the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:3-8), he was not making reason judge over revelation. He was demonstrating that Christianity is grounded in historically verifiable events. The resurrection is true regardless of anyone's assessment; our task is to show that it is *reasonable* to believe it.

The classical approach recognizes that, while reason is not autonomous or final, it remains a God-given tool for discerning truth. We do not ask unbelievers to sit in judgment over God's Word; we invite them to see that God's Word is consistent with the best evidence and soundest reasoning.

## Response to Question 3: Evidence, Interpretation, and the Preconditions of Knowledge

This question gets to the heart of our disagreement, and I appreciate the thoughtful way you've framed it. However, I believe you overstate the problem.

You argue that the criteria for evaluating historical evidence (explanatory power, coherence, etc.) cannot be justified apart from Christianity, and therefore I am asking unbelievers to "borrow Christian capital" while pretending these tools are neutral.

Let me respond by distinguishing between *justifying* these criteria and *using* them.

I agree that Christianity provides the ultimate foundation for logic, uniformity, trust in cognitive faculties, and other preconditions of knowledge. But I deny that unbelievers must first *explicitly* acknowledge this foundation before they can *use* these tools to evaluate evidence.

Why? Because these are not merely abstract philosophical principles—they are inescapable realities of human existence. Everyone, whether they admit it or not:
- Assumes the law of non-contradiction in everyday reasoning
- Expects the future to resemble the past (as you sit in a chair, you trust it won't suddenly vanish)
- Relies on their cognitive faculties to make sense of the world

As Cornelius Van Til himself recognized, unbelievers cannot consistently escape these realities. They live in God's world, using God's tools, while suppressing the truth about where those tools come from.

Now to your dilemma: either (1) unbelievers can justify preconditions apart from Christianity, or (2) I must first challenge their presuppositions before evidence can be evaluated.

I reject both options. Here is a third:

**(3)** Unbelievers cannot *ultimately* justify these preconditions apart from Christianity, but they *can* and *do* use them provisionally because they are built into human nature and God's world. My task as a classical apologist is not to help them construct an alternative epistemological foundation, but to show them that Christianity *makes sense* of the tools they are already using.

Consider the empty tomb. The fact of the empty tomb is accessible to historians regardless of their worldview. Naturalists and supernaturalists can agree that the tomb was found empty; they differ on *why*. When I argue that resurrection is the best explanation, I am not asking them to adopt a neutral standard of "best explanation." I am asking them to see that *their own* standards—whatever they are—point most consistently toward resurrection.

If they say, "I reject the resurrection because miracles are impossible," then we can discuss whether naturalism can justify uniformity of nature (it cannot) and whether Christianity can (it can). But this presuppositional discussion *arises naturally* from evaluating the evidence, not *prior* to it.

The presuppositional insight about the preconditions of knowledge is valuable and true. But classical apologetes need not deny this insight. We simply believe that the best way to *bring people* to recognize it is through the cumulative case of evidence—showing them that Christianity explains reality better than any alternative worldview.

In short: facts do not come with interpretation tags, but neither do they come to people with no preexisting worldview commitments. The classical approach meets people where they are, uses the shared tools they already possess (however inconsistently held), and points them toward the truth that makes those tools possible.
