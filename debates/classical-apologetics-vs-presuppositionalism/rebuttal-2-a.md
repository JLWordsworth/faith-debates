# Second Rebuttal - Classical Apologetics

My opponent's reading of Acts 17 is remarkably selective. Yes, Paul shows that the Athenians were inconsistent—that they "borrowed Christian capital" without acknowledging its source. But this does not exhaust Paul's method. He begins precisely where my opponent says we cannot begin: with an appeal to shared observation and reason. Paul identifies an altar "TO AN UNKNOWN GOD"—he takes something they already acknowledge and uses it as a bridge. He then builds a case for the Creator using natural theology: "God who made the world and everything in it" (Acts 17:24), arguing that the Creator "is not served by human hands, as if He needed anything" (v. 25). Only after establishing the Creator through reasoned argument does he call for repentance and mention the resurrection. My opponent sees this as "exposing contradictions" alone, but Paul is doing exactly what classical apologetics commends: building from general revelation to special revelation.

The charge that "all reasoning is circular" is true at the foundational level—but this does not eliminate the distinction between virtuous and vicious circularity. The presuppositionalist's circle is explicitly vicious: "Christianity is true because Christianity is true, and any objection presupposes Christianity." The classical apologist's circle is virtuous and implicit: "We use reason to evaluate worldviews because reason works, and the best explanation for why reason works is the Christian God." This is not neutral foundationalism; it is a cumulative case that Christianity best explains the very tools we must use to evaluate any worldview. My opponent asks, "On what basis do they assume that logic governs reality?" The answer: because we observe that logic *does* govern reality, and we ask which worldview best accounts for this observation. Christianity is that answer—but we must first establish that observation itself is valid.

Regarding facts and interpretation: my opponent correctly notes that facts do not come with "interpretation tags." But this observation cuts both ways. If facts are always interpreted through worldview commitments, then the presuppositionalist's claim that "unbelievers cannot reason properly" is itself an interpretation that presupposes Christianity. The classical apologist does not claim that facts are "self-interpreting" in an autonomous sense; rather, we claim that some interpretations are demonstrably better than others when judged by shared criteria like explanatory power, coherence with established facts, and avoidance of special pleading. The empty tomb is a case in point: the resurrection hypothesis explains multiple established facts (Jesus' death, the appearances, the conversion of skeptics, the rise of the church) better than rival hypotheses. This does not require neutrality; it requires only that unbelievers are sufficiently accountable to evidence to recognize a superior explanation when presented with one—a premise Romans 1:18-20 clearly teaches.

The accusation that classical apologetics makes "reason judge over revelation" is a caricature. Augustine's "I believe in order to understand" is not reversed but honored when we argue that the Christian worldview best accounts for rationality itself. We do not judge Scripture by autonomous reason; we demonstrate that Scripture's claims are rationally defensible when evaluated by standards that Scripture itself presupposes. The self-attesting nature of Scripture is indeed a necessity—but it is a necessity *because* Scripture is actually true, not because circularity is virtuous in itself. The circularity "Scripture is true because it says it is true" would be vicious for any other book; it is virtuous for Scripture only because Scripture actually *is* God's Word, and this can be shown by external evidence that supports its claim.

My opponent emphasizes the noetic effects of sin to the point of denying that unbelievers can engage in reasoned assessment of evidence. But Romans 1:21 teaches that unbelievers "suppress the truth by their wickedness"—implying that there *is* truth to be suppressed. They are not incapable of knowing truth; they are hostile to truth they nevertheless know. Paul's argument in Romans 1:18-20 is that all people *do* know God's existence and attributes through creation—they are without excuse precisely *because* this knowledge is accessible despite sin. The classical apologist does not deny that sin affects thinking; we deny that sin eliminates our shared accountability to general revelation. God holds unbelievers accountable for what they *can* and *do* know, not for what is inaccessible to them.

I appreciate my opponent's affirmation that "God's Word will not return void." This we agree on. But Scripture consistently portrays God's Word as working *through* means—through preaching, through reasoned argument, through evidence, through human witnesses. The question is not whether God is sovereign, but what means He has ordained for defending and commending the faith. Scripture presents both the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit *and* external evidences and arguments as means God uses. The classical apologist embraces both.
