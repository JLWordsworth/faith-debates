# Opening Statement - Presuppositionalism

Ladies and gentlemen, my worthy opponent, and all those seeking truth:

I stand before you today not to present Christianity as one plausible option among many, nor to argue that God's existence is probable based on evidence we both might accept. Such an approach would concede at the outset what cannot be conceded—that there exists neutral ground from which we can evaluate worldviews, that human reason operates independently of God, and that facts speak for themselves apart from any interpretive framework. I contend instead that Christianity is not merely true but necessarily true—the very foundation that makes truth, knowledge, logic, and reasoning itself possible. As the Apostle Paul declares, "In [Christ] are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge" (Colossians 2:3). Not some knowledge. Not religious knowledge. All knowledge.

Consider the most basic tools you are using right now to evaluate this debate: logic, reason, the assumption that words have meaning, the expectation that the future will resemble the past so that this conversation can even proceed. These are not brute facts we discover in nature; they are preconditions of intelligible experience that require a foundation. Materialism cannot account for abstract, invariant laws of logic. Chance cannot ground the uniformity of nature that makes science possible. Matter cannot produce moral obligation or human dignity. The non-Christian worldview, when pressed, cannot account for the very tools it uses to argue against Christianity. As Proverbs 1:7 tells us, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge." There is no knowledge worth having that is independent of reverence for God.

My opponent's approach, classical apologetics, begins by accepting the rules of engagement set by skeptics. It seeks to prove God's existence using reason and evidence apart from Scripture, hoping to build a bridge to Christianity on neutral ground. But there is no neutral ground. Christ himself declared, "He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters" (Matthew 12:30). We do not reason independently of God to God; we reason from God's revelation to understanding His world. The Bible is self-attesting, as any ultimate authority must be. To demand external proof for Scripture is to demand something impossible—every ultimate standard is self-authenticating, or it wouldn't be ultimate. We do not defend the Bible as one authority among others but as the authority by which all other claims are judged.

The presuppositional approach I advocate does not reject evidence or reason. Rather, it recognizes that evidence is always interpreted within a worldview framework. The fossil record, the existence of evil, the diversity of religions—these facts do not interpret themselves. The Christian and the non-Christian look at the same world and see different things because we begin with different foundational commitments. The question is not which worldview has better evidence but which worldview can account for evidence, truth, knowledge, logic, and science in the first place. I submit that only Christian theism—with its transcendent, personal, immutable God who created and sustains all things—can provide the necessary preconditions for the intelligibility of human experience. As Romans 11:36 reminds us, "For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever! Amen."

I look forward to demonstrating throughout this debate that the classical apologetic method, while well-intentioned, concedes too much to the skeptic and undermines the self-attesting authority of God's Word. The transcendental argument for God's existence—that if Christianity were false, nothing could be true, known, or meaningful—stands as the only apologetic that honors God's Lordship over all thought and takes seriously the noetic effects of sin described in Romans 1. Unbelievers suppress the truth they know; their problem is not lack of evidence but moral rebellion against their Creator. Apologetics, properly understood, is not information transfer but calling rebels to surrender to their rightful King.

Let us proceed with this debate, recognizing that there is no neutral ground, and may God grant us clarity as we contend for the faith once for all entrusted to the saints.
