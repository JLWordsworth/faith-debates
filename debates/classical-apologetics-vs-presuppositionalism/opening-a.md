# Opening Statement: Classical Apologetics

## The Case for Reasoned Defense of the Faith

Distinguished moderator, worthy opponent, and all who join us for this important dialogue—I stand today in the tradition of Classical Apologetics, an approach to defending the Christian faith that has been refined across two millennia of church history, from Justin Martyr's engagement with Greek philosophers to Thomas Aquinas's systematic arguments, to contemporary defenders like C.S. Lewis and William Lane Craig. At its heart, Classical Apologetics affirms that Christianity is a faith grounded in reality, supported by evidence, and eminently reasonable to believe.

## Common Ground: Where We Begin

The foundational conviction of Classical Apologetics is that sufficient common ground exists between believers and unbelievers for meaningful dialogue about spiritual truth. We share the same world, perceive the same reality, and possess rational faculties—though marred by the Fall—that can discern truth. As Paul demonstrated at the Areopagus in Acts 17, we can begin where people are, using language and concepts they understand, to build a bridge to the gospel. Paul didn't begin by quoting Scripture to the Athenian philosophers; he began with their own altar to an unknown god and their own poets, reasoning from creation to Creator. This is the classical method: starting from shared experience of reality and moving systematically toward Christian truth.

## The Two-Stage Approach: From Theism to Christianity

Classical Apologetics employs a deliberate two-stage methodology. First, we establish the existence of a theistic God through natural theology—philosophical arguments that appeal to features of the world we all experience. The cosmological argument points to a transcendent Cause of the universe's beginning. The teleological argument reveals an intelligent Designer behind cosmic fine-tuning and biological complexity. The moral argument grounds objective moral values in a transcendent Moral Lawgiver. These arguments don't prove every attribute of the Christian God, but they establish a theistic foundation that makes Christian theism plausible.

Second, having established theism, we present the specific case for Christianity through historical evidence—most centrally, the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Here we employ standard historiographical methods to demonstrate that the resurrection is the best explanation of established facts: Jesus' death by crucifixion, the empty tomb, post-mortem appearances, and the transformation of skeptics like Paul and James. This two-stage approach mirrors Paul's practice in Acts: he first argued for the Creator God, then presented Jesus as the appointed Judge resurrected from the dead.

## Why This Approach Matters

Why does this reasoned, evidence-based approach matter? First, because Scripture commands it. 1 Peter 3:15 instructs us to "always be prepared to give a defense (apologia) to everyone who asks you the reason for the hope that is in you." The Greek term *apologia* refers to a reasoned defense, a legal argument, a case presented with evidence and logic. Second, because God invites us to reason together with Him (Isaiah 1:18). Faith is not contrary to reason; it is faith seeking understanding, as Anselm so aptly put it. Third, because in an age of skepticism, people need more than claims—they need reasons to believe. Classical Apologetics respects the intelligence of skeptics and meets them where they are, answering questions rather than dismissing them.

Now, let me be clear: arguments alone do not produce faith. The Holy Spirit must work in the human heart, and there is a volitional dimension to unbelief that reason alone cannot overcome. As Paul reminds us, "the god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers" (2 Corinthians 4:4). But arguments do clear away false objections, demonstrate Christianity's intellectual credibility, and create space for the Spirit to work. They remove excuses, leaving people face-to-face with the living Christ.

## A Faith Worth Considering

Classical Apologetics presents Christianity not as a blind leap into darkness, but as a confident step into the light—supported by cosmology, consonant with consciousness, confirmed by history, and consistent with our deepest moral intuitions. It is a faith that can be embraced with both heart and mind.

I look forward to engaging my worthy opponent and exploring how best to defend the faith once for all delivered to the saints. Let the dialogue begin with gentleness, respect, and a shared commitment to truth.
