# First Rebuttal - Presuppositionalism

I appreciate my opponent's thoughtful engagement and the clear articulation of the classical approach. We indeed share a commitment to Christ's Lordship and Scripture's authority. The question before us is not whether we will defend Christianity, but how we can do so without undermining the very foundation of that defense. I contend that the classical method, despite its good intentions, concedes the decisive ground at the outset and thereby weakens the Christian witness.

My opponent cites Paul at the Areopagus as evidence for "common ground" apologetics. But this reading misses Paul's deeper strategy. Paul did not appeal to neutral facts that both Christians and Athenians could agree upon apart from God. Rather, he exposed their internal contradictions and declared that the unknown God they already worshipped—but did not properly know—was the Creator of all things. His citation of their poets was not validation of their philosophy but demonstration that even their own best thinkers, when speaking truth, were borrowing from Christian capital. As Acts 17:28 declares, "In Him we live and move and have our being"—Paul was showing that the Athenians could not even make sense of their own existence without the Christian God. This is presuppositional engagement, not neutral common ground.

The charge that presuppositionalism "presupposes what it needs to prove" misunderstands the nature of ultimate standards. All reasoning must ultimately rest on foundations that cannot be proved without circularity. The question is not whether we will be circular, but which circle can account for reality itself. When the classical apologist appeals to logic, evidence, and rational argumentation, they are presupposing the validity of these things without proof. On what basis do they assume that logic governs reality? That nature is uniform? That human reasoning can discover truth? These are presuppositions—unproven foundations that the apologist takes for granted. The presuppositionalist makes these foundations explicit: only the Christian God can account for them. We are not presupposing what we need to prove; we are acknowledging that proof itself requires Christian foundations.

Regarding the "stubborn resistance" of facts to reinterpretation, I must ask: what is a fact apart from interpretation? My opponent speaks of the empty tomb as if it were a brute datum that imposes itself equally on all observers. But who observes the empty tomb today? We have reports of an empty tomb, and those reports must be interpreted. The skeptic can interpret the empty tomb as a fabrication, a legend, a hallucination, a stolen body, or a resurrection. The "fact" of the empty tomb does not come with an interpretation tag. The classical apologist who presents this evidence as if it speaks for itself is naively assuming that facts are self-interpreting—that interpretation is not always already shaped by worldview commitments. This is precisely the error Colossians 2:8 warns against: being taken captive by philosophy based on human tradition rather than Christ.

My opponent claims that classical apologetics does not undermine Scripture's authority, citing Augustine's "I believe in order to understand" and "I understand in order to believe." But the classical approach, in practice, often reverses this order entirely. It suggests that we can evaluate Christianity's truth claims using standards of evidence and reasoning that are autonomous from Scripture—that reason sits as judge over revelation rather than servant under it. When we seek "external proof" for Scripture, we implicitly accept that Scripture's authority is insufficient until validated by something else. But Romans 3:4 declares, "Let God be true and every man a liar." We do not judge God's Word by human reason; we judge all human reasoning by God's Word. The self-attesting nature of Scripture is not a weakness to be overcome but a necessity of any ultimate authority.

The claim that classical apologetics merely affirms that humans share a created world and rational faculties designed by God sounds reasonable—but to whom are we making this affirmation? To the skeptic who denies that the world was created or that human faculties were designed? By accepting the skeptic's premise that we can agree on "basic facts about the world" apart from Christian presuppositions, we concede that there is a realm of neutral knowledge accessible to all regardless of their worldview. But Romans 1:21-22 teaches that unbelievers have become "futile in their thinking" and "fools," however wise they may appear. Their reasoning is not partially reliable but fundamentally darkened. They use logic and reason, to be sure, but they cannot account for them and are inconsistent with their own professed worldview. When we accept their claim to rational autonomy, we are not affirming the image of God; we are affirming their rebellion.

The noetic effects of sin are indeed profound, as my opponent acknowledges. But the significance of this fact is often minimized in classical apologetics. If the unregenerate mind is "hostile to God" and "cannot submit to God's law" (Romans 8:7), then how can we expect mere evidence and argumentation to overcome that hostility? How can the natural man, who "cannot understand the things that come from the Spirit of God" (1 Corinthians 2:14), be reasoned into the kingdom? This is not to deny that God uses arguments and evidence, but to recognize that the problem is not lack of information but love of darkness (John 3:19). The presuppositionalist does not withhold evidence; rather, we present evidence in the context of challenging the foundational assumptions that prevent the evidence from being seen rightly.

My opponent concludes by affirming that the Holy Spirit must use our apologetic efforts to bring conviction and conversion. Here we find common ground. The question is: what apologetic approach most faithfully represents God's means of confronting unbelief? Scripture consistently presents God's Word as doing the work—demolishing arguments, taking every thought captive, shining light into darkness. The presuppositionalist trusts that when we challenge non-Christian thought at its foundational level and present Christ as the necessary precondition for all meaning and knowledge, God's Word will not return void. We do not need to meet the skeptic on supposedly neutral ground and argue Christianity upward. We present Christ as Lord of all, the foundation without which nothing makes sense, and call rebels to surrender. This is not less rational; it is fully rational, because it recognizes that rationality itself has no home apart from Christ.
