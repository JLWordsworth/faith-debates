# Closing Statement - Classical Apologetics

As this debate draws to a close, I want to express my genuine appreciation for my opponent's thoughtful defense of presuppositionalism. The emphasis on God's sovereignty over all human thought, the reality of the noetic effects of sin, and the self-attesting authority of Scripture are vital insights that every Christian apologist should take seriously. Van Til was right to remind us that there is no neutral ground in the ultimate sense—that all of us, believer and unbeliever alike, stand before God as either loyal subjects or rebels, and that Christ's Lordship extends to every area of life, including our reasoning. These truths are not optional; they are foundational.

However, I remain convinced that the classical two-stage approach best honors both the biblical pattern of apologetics and the reality of how God actually draws people to Himself. Consider again the witness of Scripture. When Paul engaged the Athenians, he did not begin by dismantling their presuppositions or demanding they accept the Bible's authority before conversation could proceed. He began with an altar they had erected—a point of contact, however distorted—and built from there. When Jesus engaged the rich young ruler, He did not begin by challenging the young man's epistemological foundations; He appealed to the commandments the young man already knew. When Peter preached at Pentecost, he did not begin by explaining the preconditions of knowledge; he proclaimed the resurrection of Jesus, backed by evidence his hearers could verify for themselves.

The classical approach does not deny that the Holy Spirit is essential for conversion. As I have emphasized throughout this debate, arguments alone do not produce faith. The Spirit must work. But the Spirit ordinarily works through means—through preaching, through reasoned argument, through evidence, through human witnesses who give "the reason for the hope that is within them" (1 Peter 3:15). The classical apologist presents Christianity as a faith that makes sense of the world as it actually is—a world of cause and effect, beauty and brutality, meaning and morality. We demonstrate that the resurrection is the best explanation of the historical facts. We argue that objective morality points to a Moral Lawgiver. We show that the universe's fine-tuning points to an intelligent Designer. And we pray that the Holy Spirit will use these means to bring conviction and conversion.

The presuppositionalist worries that this approach makes human reason the final judge over God's Word. But this is a caricature. We do not judge Scripture by autonomous reason; we demonstrate that Scripture's claims are rationally defensible when evaluated by standards that Scripture itself presupposes—standards like logic, evidence, and coherence. The self-attesting nature of Scripture is indeed a necessity—but it is a necessity because Scripture is actually true, and this can be shown by external evidence that supports its claim. The circularity "Scripture is true because it says it is true" would be vicious for any other book; it is virtuous for Scripture only because Scripture actually is God's Word, and this can be shown by evidence that confirms its claim.

My opponent has rightly emphasized that facts do not come with "interpretation tags." But this observation cuts both ways. If facts are always interpreted through worldview commitments, then the presuppositionalist's claim that "unbelievers cannot reason properly" is itself an interpretation that presupposes Christianity. The classical apologist does not claim that facts are "self-interpreting" in an autonomous sense; rather, we claim that some interpretations are demonstrably better than others when judged by shared criteria like explanatory power, coherence with established facts, and avoidance of special pleading. The empty tomb is a case in point: the resurrection hypothesis explains multiple established facts better than rival hypotheses. This does not require neutrality; it requires only that unbelievers are sufficiently accountable to evidence to recognize a superior explanation when presented with one—a premise Romans 1:18-20 clearly teaches.

In the end, both approaches recognize that God's truth is the ultimate standard. The question is how best to bring people to recognize this standard. The presuppositionalist says we must first challenge their foundational assumptions. The classical apologist says we should meet them where they are, using the shared tools they already possess (however inconsistently held), and point them toward the truth that makes those tools possible. History demonstrates that both approaches can be used by God. What matters most is not which method we employ, but that we present Christ faithfully, answer questions honestly, and trust the Spirit to do His work.

Classical apologetics presents Christianity not as a blind leap into darkness, but as a confident step into the light—supported by cosmology, consonant with consciousness, confirmed by history, and consistent with our deepest moral intuitions. It is a faith that can be embraced with both heart and mind. And that, I submit, is a faith worth defending to a watching world.
