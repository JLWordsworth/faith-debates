# Cross-Examination Questions - Debater A (Classical Apologetics)

## Question 1: Biblical Examples of Reasoned Argument

You consistently argue that there is "no neutral ground" and that we cannot "reason independently of God to God," but this creates tension with numerous biblical examples where God's people engage in reasoned argument using shared premises with unbelievers. Consider these cases:

- **Elijah on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18)**: Elijah proposed a test—"you call upon the name of your god, and I will call upon the name of the LORD. The God who answers by fire, he is God." This was a public evidentiary test that both Israelites and Baal worshippers could observe and evaluate. Why did Elijah not simply declare Yahweh's self-attesting authority and demand submission?

- **Jesus before Annas and Caiaphas (John 18)**: When questioned about His teaching, Jesus replied, "I have spoken openly to the world... I said nothing in secret. Ask those who heard me." Jesus appealed to empirical testimony that His accusers could verify, not merely to His self-attesting authority.

- **Paul's defense before Felix (Acts 24)**: Paul reasoned about "righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment" using concepts that Felix, a Roman governor, could understand. Paul did not begin by demanding Felix submit to Scripture's authority; he built a case from shared moral concepts.

How do you reconcile your position that "there is no neutral ground" and "we do not reason independently of God to God" with these biblical examples where God's servants clearly used evidence, public tests, and reasoned appeals that did not require prior acceptance of Scripture's authority?

## Question 2: The Problem of First Contact

Your position insists that "the Bible is self-attesting, as any ultimate authority must be" and that "to demand external proof for Scripture is to demand something impossible." Yet this creates a practical problem: how do you engage someone who, from the outset, rejects the Bible's authority?

Consider a literal atheist who says: "I don't accept the Bible as authoritative. It's just an ancient book of myths and legends. Why should I treat it differently than the Quran or the Book of Mormon?" According to your framework, you cannot appeal to neutral evidence (they would reject it as borrowing their standards), you cannot argue to the Bible (they reject it as circular), and you cannot reason from shared experience (there is no neutral ground).

What is your actual first move in this conversation? Do you:
a) Refuse to engage until they accept Scripture's authority?
b) Attempt to demonstrate that their worldview cannot account for logic, science, and morality—but if so, aren't you appealing to shared concepts that they do accept?
c) Something else?

And if option (b), aren't you admitting that there *is* some common ground—the shared use of logic, the shared experience of moral obligation, the shared practice of reasoning—that allows for meaningful dialogue?

## Question 3: The Relationship Between Evidence and Presupposition

You wrote in your first rebuttal: "I do not reject evidence or reason. Rather, I recognize that evidence is always interpreted within a worldview framework." Later, you stated: "The question is not which worldview has better evidence but which worldview can account for evidence, truth, knowledge, logic, and science in the first place."

This raises a crucial question: On what basis do we choose between competing worldview accounts? You dismiss classical apologetics for appealing to "shared criteria like explanatory power," but you offer no alternative criterion. If we ask:
- Why prefer Christianity's account of logic over Islam's account?
- Why prefer the Christian view of morality over the Buddhist view?
- Why accept the biblical worldview over the secular one?

Your answer appears to be: because only Christianity *can* account for these things. But the Muslim would say the same about Islam. The secular philosopher would say naturalism accounts for them better (perhaps through evolutionary accounts of logic as adaptive behavior). On what basis do we adjudicate these competing claims without appealing to some shared criterion—explanatory power, coherence with experience, internal consistency—that all parties can recognize?

It appears you are caught in a dilemma: either (1) you appeal to shared criteria (which concedes neutral ground), or (2) you have no way to distinguish Christianity from other worldviews beyond bare assertion. Which do you choose?
