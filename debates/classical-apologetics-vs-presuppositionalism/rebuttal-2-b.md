# Second Rebuttal - Presuppositionalism

My opponent continues to read Acts 17 through the lens of classical methodology, but the text does not support this interpretation. Paul's reference to the "UNKNOWN GOD" is not an appeal to "shared observation" as neutral common ground—it is an exposure of the Athenians' suppression of the truth they already know. Paul is not building from general revelation to special revelation as two separate sources; he is proclaiming the God they already know but refuse to acknowledge. The Creator-creature distinction Paul employs is not a conclusion reached through neutral reasoning—it is the biblical framework that the Athenians, like all unbelievers, already presuppose in practice while denying in theory. Romans 1:19-20 tells us that "what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them." They are not missing information; they are suppressing what they know. Paul's sermon in Acts 17, properly understood, is an exposition of this suppression—he is taking knowledge they possess but distort and bringing it into the light of God's revelation.

The distinction between "virtuous and vicious circularity" proves my point. My opponent acknowledges that all reasoning is circular at the foundational level. But then he claims that his circle is "virtuous and implicit" while mine is "explicitly vicious." On what basis does he judge which circularity is virtuous? He appeals to "observation" and "explanatory power"—but these very standards require justification. Why should we think that observation corresponds to reality? Why is explanatory power a criterion for truth? These questions cannot be answered without presupposing something about the nature of reality, knowledge, and logic. The classical apologist's circle is not "implicit"—it is unacknowledged. He presupposes Christian truths (the reliability of reason, the uniformity of nature, the validity of logic) while claiming to argue from neutral premises. This is not virtuous circularity; it is borrowed capital. At least the presuppositionalist is honest about where we begin: with the self-attesting Word of God.

My opponent's claim that "some interpretations are demonstrably better than others" when judged by "shared criteria like explanatory power" again presupposes what he cannot prove. He writes that "we observe that logic does govern reality, and we ask which worldview best accounts for this observation." But the observation itself—the very possibility of observation—presupposes that our cognitive faculties are reliable, that there is a reality to be observed, and that logic governs the relationship between our thoughts and that reality. These are not neutral observations; they are Christian presuppositions. The materialist cannot account for any of them. When my opponent says we must "first establish that observation itself is valid," he is simply pushing the problem back one step. On what basis do we establish it? By using more observation? That is vicious circularity. By using reason? That presupposes the validity of reasoning. We have reached the foundations, and the only question is which foundation we acknowledge: the self-attesting God of Scripture or autonomous human reason.

Regarding the charge that classical apologetics makes "reason judge over revelation"—my opponent protests that this is a caricature. But consider his own words: "We do not judge Scripture by autonomous reason; we demonstrate that Scripture's claims are rationally defensible when evaluated by standards that Scripture itself presupposes." The question is: who determines whether Scripture is being "rationally defensible"? Who determines what Scripture "presupposes"? When my opponent says that "Scripture's claims are rationally defensible when evaluated by standards that Scripture itself presupposes," he is placing human judgment in the position of determining whether Scripture meets those standards. He says that the self-attesting nature of Scripture is virtuous "because Scripture actually is true, and this can be shown by external evidence." But this places external evidence in the position of judge over Scripture's truth. The self-attesting Word does not need external evidence to attest to its truthfulness; external evidence attests to its truthfulness only when interpreted by the self-attesting Word. My opponent has this precisely backward.

My opponent's reading of Romans 1:18-20 is fundamentally mistaken. He writes that "unbelievers are not incapable of knowing truth; they are hostile to truth they nevertheless know." I agree completely—but this defeats his entire apologetic approach. If unbelievers already know the truth but are hostile to it, why would presenting more evidence or arguments change anything? Their problem is not lack of information but suppression of what they know. Romans 1:21 tells us that "although they knew God, they neither glorified Him as God nor gave thanks to Him." The knowledge is present; the suppression is active. The classical apologetic method treats unbelief as if it were primarily an intellectual deficiency that can be remedied by more information. But Scripture portrays unbelief as moral rebellion that suppresses known truth. This is why 2 Corinthians 10:4-5 describes apologetics as warfare that "demolishes arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God"—not as a polite conversation where we present evidence to neutral observers.

My opponent affirms that "God's Word will not return void" and that "Scripture presents both the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit and external evidences and arguments as means God uses." I agree that God uses means—but He uses them according to His Word, not our wisdom about what methods should work. The internal testimony of the Holy Spirit is not one means among others; it is the means without which all other means are futile. As 1 Corinthians 2:14 reminds us, "the natural man does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God. For they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned." External evidences and arguments have their place, but only when empowered by the Spirit working through the Word. When we present evidence as if it could persuade apart from the Spirit's testimony through Scripture, we are trusting in the flesh rather than in God.

I urge my opponent to consider: if unbelief is suppression of known truth rather than lack of evidence, if all reasoning depends on presuppositions that cannot be proved without circularity, and if the Holy Spirit's testimony through Scripture is necessary for persuasion—then why do we continue to approach apologetics as if we could argue from neutral ground? Let us instead stand boldly on the self-attesting Word of God and challenge the unbeliever's presuppositions, showing that only Christianity provides the foundation for the very reasoning they employ.
