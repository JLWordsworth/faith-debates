# First Rebuttal - Classical Apologetics

I thank my worthy opponent for a thoughtful opening statement that raises important questions about how we defend the Christian faith. We agree on far more than we disagree—both of us affirm the truth of Christianity, the authority of Scripture, and the reality that all knowledge finds its source in God. Where we differ is on *how* to engage those who do not yet share these convictions. I contend that the classical approach, far from conceding too much, actually follows the biblical pattern of meeting people where they are and leading them to truth through evidence and reason.

My opponent argues that there is "no neutral ground" from which to evaluate worldviews, citing Christ's words that "He who is not with Me is against Me." Yet this text speaks to ultimate allegiance, not to whether believers and non-believers can agree on basic facts about the world. When Paul engaged the Athenians at the Areopagus (Acts 17), he did not begin by demanding they accept the authority of Scripture. Instead, he acknowledged their religiosity, quoted their own poets, and argued from creation to the Creator. He found common ground—their altar to an "unknown god"—and used it as a bridge to the gospel. If there were truly no common ground, Paul's approach would be impossible. Yet God used it to bring people to faith.

The transcendental argument my opponent champions—that Christianity alone can account for logic, knowledge, and science—is indeed powerful, but it is not the only legitimate apologetic approach. More importantly, it presupposes what it needs to prove. When we ask someone to accept that "only Christian theism can account for the intelligibility of experience," we are asking them to accept a conclusion that they, by definition, cannot recognize as true if they are not already Christians. The classical approach, by contrast, begins where people actually are—with questions about God's existence, the problem of evil, the historical Jesus—and shows that Christianity provides compelling answers. This is not conceding neutrality; it is wise engagement.

Consider the issue of evidence and interpretation. My opponent states that "evidence is always interpreted within a worldview framework," which is partly true. But it is not wholly true. Some facts are stubbornly resistant to reinterpretation. The empty tomb of Jesus is such a fact. Both Christians and skeptics must explain it, but they cannot make it go away. The resurrection either happened or it did not. The historical evidence—eyewitness testimony, the conversion of skeptics like Paul and James, the rapid spread of Christianity in Jerusalem where the events occurred—points compellingly to resurrection as the best explanation. The classical apologist presents this evidence and invites consideration. The presuppositionalist, by contrast, may short-circuit this investigation by insisting that no evidence can be meaningfully evaluated apart from Christian presuppositions. Which approach actually honors the evidence as evidence?

My opponent accuses classical apologetics of undermining "the self-attesting authority of God's Word" by seeking external proof for Scripture. But this misunderstands the classical approach. We do not believe Scripture *needs* external proof to be authoritative. God's Word is authoritative because it is God's Word. However, we also recognize that many people do not accept this authority and need reasons to consider it seriously. Augustine's dictum applies here: "I believe in order to understand," but also, "I understand in order to believe." Faith and reason are not enemies but allies. The classical approach recognizes that God has left witnesses to Himself in creation and history (general revelation) that can lead people to the fuller witness of Scripture (special revelation). As Romans 1:20 teaches, God's existence and attributes are "clearly seen" in what has been made.

What of the claim that classical apologetics "concedes too much" by accepting the skeptic's rules of engagement? I would argue that it concedes exactly what is true and useful: that we share a created world, rational faculties designed by God, and the ability to recognize truth when it is presented. These are not concessions to skepticism but affirmations of what it means to be human creatures made in God's image. The noetic effects of sin are real—our reasoning is fallen and prone to error—but it is not so thoroughly corrupted that we cannot agree that 2+2=4, that murder is wrong, or that historical events actually happened. To deny this is not to honor God's sovereignty but to underestimate the damage sin has done and the grace God has preserved.

How, then, do we engage someone who does not accept the Bible's authority? We do what Jesus did with the rich young ruler, what Paul did in the synagogues and the Areopagus, what Peter did at Pentecost: we present evidence, we make arguments, we tell the story, and we invite consideration. We show that Christianity makes sense of the world as it actually is—the world of beauty and brutality, of love and loss, of science and sacrifice. We demonstrate that the resurrection is the best explanation of the historical facts. We argue that objective morality points to a Moral Lawgiver. And we pray that the Holy Spirit will use these means to bring conviction and conversion. This is not information transfer, as my opponent puts it, but it is also not merely "calling rebels to surrender." It is providing reasonable grounds for faith that the Spirit can use to draw people to Christ.

In closing, let me reaffirm my appreciation for the presuppositional emphasis on God's sovereignty in all things, including human thought. That emphasis is needed and valuable. But I submit that the classical approach better follows the biblical pattern of apologetics, better honors the evidence God has provided in creation and history, and better engages real people where they actually are. The transcendental argument is one arrow in our quiver, but it should not be the only one. Let us use every legitimate means to commend Christ to a watching world.
