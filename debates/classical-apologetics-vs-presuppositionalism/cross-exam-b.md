# Cross-Examination Questions - Debater B (Presuppositionalism)

## Question 1: Neutral Ground and the Noetic Effects of Sin

You argue that "sufficient common ground exists between believers and unbelievers for meaningful dialogue" and that we can "begin where people are, using language and concepts they understand, to build a bridge to the gospel." But this seems to minimize the noetic effects of sin described in Romans 8:7: "The mind of the flesh is hostile to God: It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so."

If the unregenerate mind is fundamentally hostile to God and *cannot* submit to God's law, on what basis do you claim that we can reason together with unbelievers about spiritual truth using shared rational faculties? You appeal to Paul's engagement at the Areopagus as your model, but Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 2:14 that "the natural man does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God. For they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned."

When you say that unbelievers can evaluate evidence for Christianity using their "shared rational faculties," aren't you assuming that those faculties are operating reliably enough to reach true spiritual conclusions despite being hostile to God? If sin has so thoroughly affected the mind that it is hostile to God and cannot submit to His law, how can mere evidence and rational argumentation overcome that hostility? Doesn't your approach effectively treat unbelief as an intellectual problem rather than the moral rebellion Scripture describes in John 3:19: "This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil"?

## Question 2: The Final Authority—Reason or Revelation?

Throughout this debate, you have insisted that classical apologetics does not make "reason judge over revelation." Yet consider your actual method: you present evidence (cosmological arguments, historical data for the resurrection) and invite unbelievers to evaluate this evidence using rational standards like "explanatory power," "coherence with established facts," and "avoidance of special pleading."

Here is the tension: Who determines whether Christianity meets these standards? The unbeliever, using their autonomous reason, is asked to judge whether the evidence is sufficient. But as you yourself acknowledge, the unbeliever's mind is hostile to God and suppresses the truth in unrighteousness (Romans 1:18). On what basis do you expect someone whose mind is hostile to God to correctly evaluate spiritual evidence using their own reasoning?

You wrote in your second rebuttal: "We do not judge Scripture by autonomous reason; we demonstrate that Scripture's claims are rationally defensible when evaluated by standards that Scripture itself presupposes." But this creates an inescapable dilemma: either (1) the unbeliever accepts that Scripture presupposes these standards—which would mean they already accept Scripture's authority, rendering your argument unnecessary; or (2) the unbeliever rejects that Scripture presupposes these standards and instead evaluates your claims using their own autonomous standards—which makes human reason the final judge of revelation.

If the unbeliever rejects your evidence as insufficient, have they failed to meet an objective standard that exists independently of God's revelation, or have they simply exercised their autonomous reason contrary to God's Word? And if the latter, why have you placed yourself in a position where their autonomous reasoning becomes the arbiter of whether Christianity is credible?

## Question 3: Evidence, Interpretation, and the Preconditions of Knowledge

You have repeatedly emphasized that some facts are "stubbornly resistant to reinterpretation," citing the empty tomb as a prime example. You wrote: "The resurrection either happened or it did not. The historical evidence...points compellingly to resurrection as the best explanation."

But this statement assumes what you need to prove: that historical evidence can be objectively evaluated apart from presuppositional commitments. Consider: on what basis does the unbeliever determine that the resurrection is or is not the "best explanation"? They must use criteria like explanatory power, coherence with other facts, and avoidance of ad hoc assumptions. But on what foundation do these criteria rest?

- Why is explanatory power a criterion for truth in a materialistic universe?
- Why should we expect the future to resemble the past (uniformity of nature) so that historical investigation is possible?
- Why trust that human cognitive faculties are reliable enough to discover truth about the past?

These are not brute facts or neutral observations. They are preconditions of historical knowledge that must be accounted for within a worldview framework. The materialist cannot provide a foundation for them. When you ask an unbeliever to use these criteria to evaluate the resurrection, you are asking them to borrow Christian capital—to use tools that only Christianity can justify—while pretending these tools are neutral shared ground.

You claim that "facts do not come with interpretation tags," but you proceed as if the criteria for evaluating those facts do come with "validity tags" that any reasonable person must accept. They do not. The question is not whether the empty tomb is a fact, but what worldview can account for the very possibility of historical knowledge, truth, explanation, and rational evaluation. If Christianity alone provides these preconditions, then presenting the resurrection as "the best explanation" apart from challenging the unbeliever's foundational assumptions is to present evidence within a framework they cannot consistently justify.

How do you escape this dilemma without either (1) conceding that unbelievers can justify the preconditions of knowledge apart from Christianity (which undermines your claim that Christianity is necessary for knowledge), or (2) acknowledging that you must first challenge their presuppositions before any evidence can be meaningfully evaluated (which is the presuppositional approach)?
