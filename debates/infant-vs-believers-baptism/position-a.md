# Paedobaptism (Infant Baptism)

## Overview

Paedobaptism is the practice of baptizing infants and young children, based on the understanding that baptism is the New Testament sign of the covenant community, analogous to circumcision in the Old Testament. This position holds that children of believing parents are included in the covenant of grace and should therefore receive the covenant sign of baptism, though they must later personally affirm their faith through confirmation.

## Core Beliefs

- **Covenant Continuity**: Baptism is the New Testament counterpart to Old Testament circumcision, serving as the sign and seal of entrance into the covenant community
- **Household Inclusion**: The biblical pattern of household baptisms suggests that children were included when entire households came to faith
- **God's Covenant Promises**: God's covenant promises extend to believers and their children, as demonstrated throughout Scripture
- **Grace Precedes Faith**: Baptism signifies God's gracious initiative toward us before we can respond in faith
- **Church Membership**: Children of believers are part of the covenant community and should receive the covenant sign

## Key Arguments

### 1. Circumcision-Baptism Correspondence

The strongest theological argument for infant baptism is the correspondence between circumcision and baptism. In Colossians 2:11-12, Paul explicitly links these two signs:

> "In Him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of your sinful nature, with the circumcision performed by Christ and not by human hands. And having been buried with Him in baptism, you were raised with Him through your faith in the power of God, who raised Him from the dead."

Just as circumcision was administered to infant males at eight days old as the sign of entrance into God's covenant (Genesis 17:9-14), baptism is now the sign of entrance into the new covenant. If infants received the Old Covenant sign, they should also receive the New Covenant sign, which is more inclusive and gracious.

### 2. Household Baptisms in Acts

The book of Acts records several household baptisms, which strongly suggest the inclusion of children:

- **Lydia's Household** (Acts 16:15): "And when she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, 'If you consider me a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my house.'"
- **The Philippian Jailer** (Acts 16:33-34): "At that hour of the night, the jailer took them and washed their wounds. And without delay, he and all his household were baptized."
- **Crispus and the Corinthians** (Acts 18:8): "Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his whole household believed in the Lord. And many of the Corinthians who heard the message believed and were baptized."
- **Stephanas's Household** (1 Corinthians 1:16): "Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas..."

The consistent use of "household" (oikos) in these contexts, combined with the Greco-Roman practice of including children and slaves in household conversions, suggests that entire families were baptized.

### 3. Covenant Promises to Children

Throughout Scripture, God's covenant promises explicitly include children:

- **Abrahamic Covenant** (Genesis 17:7): "I will establish My covenant as an everlasting covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you."
- **Pentecost Promise** (Acts 2:39): "The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call."
- **Household Salvation** (Acts 16:31): "They replied, 'Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household.'"

These promises demonstrate that God's covenant dealings consistently include families, not just individual believers.

### 4. Jesus' Welcome of Children

Jesus' attitude toward children reveals their place in the kingdom:

> "Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." (Matthew 19:14; Mark 10:14; Luke 18:16)

Jesus explicitly rebuked his disciples for hindering children from coming to him. If Jesus welcomed children and declared the kingdom belongs to them, the church should not withhold the covenant sign from them.

### 5. The Nature of the Covenant

The new covenant is described as more inclusive and gracious than the old covenant. Jeremiah 31:31-34 prophesies a covenant written on hearts. If the Old Covenant included infants, how could the New Covenant—described as better and more inclusive—exclude them? Paul explicitly states that Gentiles who were once "aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise" have now been "brought near" (Ephesians 2:12), not pushed farther away.

### 6. Original Sin and the Need for Grace

Psalm 51:5 acknowledges, "Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me." Ephesians 2:3 describes us as "by nature children of wrath." Infant baptism acknowledges that children are born with a sinful nature and are in need of God's grace from the beginning of life.

### 7. Historical Witness

The practice of infant baptism is attested from the earliest centuries of church history:
- Irenaeus (c. 130-202) speaks of Jesus being "born and baptized so that He might sanctify the infant" (Against Heresies)
- Hippolytus (c. 170-235) describes the baptism of children in the Apostolic Tradition
- Origen (c. 185-254) refers to infant baptism as an "apostolic tradition"

- **Romans 4:11** - Circumcision was a "sign and seal" of righteousness by faith

## Debate Style

As a paedobaptist debater, you should:

1. **Emphasize Covenant Theology**: Frame your arguments around the continuity between the Old and New Covenants. Stress that the New Covenant fulfills and expands the Old rather than replacing it entirely.

2. **Appeal to Biblical Patterns**: While Scripture never explicitly describes an infant being baptized, consistently point to the household baptism narratives and the covenant patterns that suggest their inclusion.

3. **Highlight God's Initiative**: Emphasize that baptism is primarily about God's grace toward us, not our faith toward God. Grace precedes and makes faith possible.

4. **Be Charitable**: Acknowledge that credobaptist (believer's baptism) brothers and sisters are not denying God's grace to children, but rather have a different understanding of baptism's nature and timing.

5. **Address Common Objections**:
   - **"No explicit infant baptisms in Scripture"**: Note the absence of any command to stop including children, and the household baptism patterns
   - **"Baptism should follow profession"**: Explain that baptism marks entrance into the covenant community, while profession marks personal appropriation of its promises
   - **"Infants can't believe"**: Distinguish between conscious faith and the covenant status that belongs to children of believers

6. **Use Historical Theology**: Reference the broad historical support for infant baptism across Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions (Reformed, Lutheran, Anglican).

7. **Focus on Grace**: Frame baptism as God's promise to us and our children, not as our testimony of faith.

8. **Practical Emphasis**: Highlight how infant baptism witnesses to the truth that salvation is God's work, not human achievement, and provides a tangible way for the church to commit to raising children in the faith.

Remember to maintain a gracious, irenic tone while presenting a robust theological case for the inclusion of children in the covenant sign of baptism.
