# Second Rebuttal: Believers Baptism (Credobaptism)

## Visible vs. Invisible Covenant Community

My opponent argues that the new covenant, like the old, has a visible community that includes both believers and their children, marked by a covenant sign. He notes that Esau and Ishmael received circumcision despite never being truly part of spiritual Israel. This comparison reveals a crucial difference between the covenants that my opponent has not addressed.

Under the old covenant, the visible and invisible communities largely overlapped because membership was determined by physical birth. If you were born to Jewish parents, you received circumcision and were considered part of Israel. Some, like Esau, proved unfaithful—but they were still externally part of the covenant community.

But Jeremiah's prophecy of the new covenant explicitly contrasts it with the old: "No longer will each man teach his neighbor or his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' because they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest" (Jeremiah 31:34). Under the new covenant, covenant membership is defined by personal knowledge of God. The warning passages in Hebrews (6:4-6; 10:26-29) presume that someone can participate in the covenant community—having "tasted the heavenly gift," been "made partakers of the Holy Spirit," and "tasted the good word of God"—and yet fall away. This suggests that the new covenant community is not a mixed community of believers and their children, but of those who have experienced the new covenant realities. The sign should mark those who belong to the covenant community—which under the new covenant means those who have believed.

## The Household Texts: Grammar and Context

My opponent reinterprets Acts 16:34 to suggest the household rejoiced that the jailer had believed. However, the Greek text reads differently: "he rejoiced with all his house that he had believed in God" (Hēscharēsen de holō tō oikō autō hoti episteusen eis ton theon). The rejoicing was shared by the entire household, and the belief is attributed to the jailer—but the rejoicing itself presupposes understanding. Infants cannot rejoice about religious conversion any more than they can profess faith.

More importantly, my opponent's position places the burden of proof on the wrong side. The question is not: "Does the text explicitly exclude children?" but rather: "What is the apostolic pattern for baptism?" Every single example, without exception, shows baptism following belief. If the apostles intended for children of believers to be baptized, why is there no example of it? Why no instruction about it? Why no controversy? The Jerusalem Council debated whether Gentile converts needed circumcision—if baptism replaced circumcision for covenant children, this would have been the perfect context to address it. Yet they concluded that Gentiles did not need circumcision at all.

## The Kingdom Belongs to Such as These

My opponent asks: if the kingdom belongs to children, on what basis do we withhold the kingdom's sign from them? This question contains an assumption I must challenge: baptism is not presented in Scripture as "the kingdom's sign." The kingdom belongs to children in the sense that they are welcome in God's presence and capable of trusting Jesus. But baptism is a specific ordinance given by Christ to His church, with a specific meaning: identification with Christ's death and resurrection.

Jesus welcomed children, He blessed them, He laid hands on them and prayed for them. We should do the same. But welcoming children is not the same as baptizing them. The Lord's Supper is also Christ's ordinance—do we give it to infants? No, because it requires understanding. Baptism, as a testimony of personal faith, similarly requires understanding.

## The Nature of Signs and Seals

My opponent correctly notes that Romans 4:11 calls circumcision a "sign and seal" of righteousness Abraham possessed by faith. But notice the order: Abraham possessed righteousness *by faith* first, then circumcision was given as a sign and seal of what he already possessed. The sign did not confer the reality; it marked it. Similarly, baptism marks the reality of regeneration and faith that already exists. If infants are not yet regenerate, what reality does their baptism mark? What are we sealing?

The symbolism of Romans 6 is clear: we are buried with Christ through baptism and raised to walk in newness of life. This presupposes that the person has already died to sin and been raised to new life. As Colossians 2:12 says, we are raised "through your faith." The reality—faith—precedes and gives meaning to the symbol.

## A Final Question

My opponent and I both want to honor God and be faithful to Scripture. We both want to see our children come to faith. The question is: what does Scripture teach about baptism?

The consistent New Testament pattern—every example, every command, every theological explanation—presupposes personal faith as the prerequisite for baptism. The silence on infant baptism is deafening. The symbolism requires understanding. The new covenant is made with those who know God. Baptism testifies to what God has already done.

I ask my opponent: if the apostles practiced infant baptism, why is there no evidence of it in Scripture? Why does every baptism follow belief? These are not incidental details—they are the pattern God has given us.
