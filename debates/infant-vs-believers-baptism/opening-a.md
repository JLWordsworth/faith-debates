# Opening Statement: Paedobaptism (Infant Baptism)

## The Covenant Sign of Grace

Honorable moderator, worthy opponent, and all who seek truth on this matter: I present the case for paedobaptism—the baptism of infants and young children of believing parents. My position rests on a fundamental conviction: God's covenant dealings with His people have always included families, and the New Testament sign of baptism stands in direct continuity with the Old Testament sign of circumcision as the mark of covenant membership.

## The Circumcision-Baptism Correspondence

The cornerstone of my argument is the explicit connection Scripture makes between circumcision and baptism. In Colossians 2:11-12, the Apostle Paul writes, "In Him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of your sinful nature, with the circumcision performed by Christ and not by human hands. And having been buried with Him in baptism, you were raised with Him through your faith in the power of God, who raised Him from the dead." Paul presents these two signs as counterparts—the old sign replaced by the new, yet both functioning as the mark of belonging to God's covenant people.

Under the Old Covenant, circumcision was administered to infant males at eight days old (Genesis 17:9-14). It was not a sign of their personal faith—which they had not yet consciously expressed—but of God's covenant promise to them and their families. If infants received the sign of the Old Covenant, how can we exclude them from the sign of the New Covenant, which Scripture presents as more inclusive and more gracious, not less?

## Covenant Promises Extend to Children

Throughout redemptive history, God's covenant promises have consistently included children. To Abraham, God declared, "I will establish My covenant as an everlasting covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you" (Genesis 17:7). At Pentecost, Peter proclaimed, "The promise is for you and your children" (Acts 2:39). When the Philippian jailer asked what he must do to be saved, Paul answered, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household" (Acts 16:31).

The book of Acts records multiple household baptisms—Lydia's household, the Philippian jailer's household, Crispus's household, and the household of Stephanas. While these texts do not explicitly state that infants were present, the consistent use of "household" (oikos) in contexts where conversion is described, combined with the Old Testament pattern of including children in the covenant, strongly suggests their inclusion.

## Grace Precedes Faith

Finally, infant baptism beautifully embodies the gospel truth that grace precedes faith. Our children are born in need of God's grace, as Scripture acknowledges: "Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me" (Psalm 51:5). Baptism testifies that God's grace reaches out to us before we can respond, that His initiative precedes our faith. Children of believers are members of the covenant community by birth, and baptism marks this status—a status they will later be called to personally affirm through confirmation and a living faith.

Jesus Himself welcomed little children, saying, "Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these" (Matthew 19:14). If Jesus welcomed children and declared the kingdom belongs to them, the church should not withhold from them the sign of that kingdom.

I look forward to developing these arguments further and engaging thoughtfully with my opponent's perspective.
