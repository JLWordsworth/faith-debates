# Cross-Examination Questions for Debater A (Paedobaptism)

## Question 1

You argue that the new covenant is "better" and "more excellent" than the old, and therefore should not exclude covenant children. But Jeremiah 31:31-34 explicitly contrasts the new covenant with the old by stating: "No longer will each man teach his neighbor or his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' because they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest." This describes a covenant community consisting exclusively of those who personally know God.

Given this explicit contrast—where the old covenant included those who needed to be taught to know the LORD, but the new covenant consists of those who already know Him—on what basis do you argue that the new covenant should include those (infants) who cannot yet know the Lord? Does the "better" covenant actually have *lower* standards for membership than the old?

## Question 2

You correctly note that circumcision was a "sign and seal" of Abraham's faith (Romans 4:11). However, Abraham possessed righteousness *by faith* *before* he received circumcision (Genesis 15:6; Genesis 17:24). The sign marked an existing reality, not a future promise.

If you apply this pattern to baptism—baptism as sign and seal of regeneration and faith—then baptism should follow faith, as it did with Abraham. But your position seems to be that baptism marks a *future* reality (the child's eventual faith). How do you reconcile administering a sign and seal to those who do not possess the reality it signifies? Does this not turn the sign into something different than what circumcision was for Abraham?

## Question 3

The book of Acts records approximately 12-15 specific baptism narratives following Pentecost, spanning roughly 30 years of early church history. In every single instance, the text explicitly links baptism to belief, repentance, or confession of faith. Additionally, the Jerusalem Council in Acts 15 debated the fundamental question of who belongs to the people of God and whether Gentiles needed circumcision—yet baptism of children is never discussed.

If infant baptism was the apostolic practice, as you argue, how do you explain its complete absence from the historical record of Acts and from the most significant theological debate in the early church? Why would the Holy Spirit inspire Luke to record every instance of believers being baptized but omit any example of infants being baptized if that was the normative practice?
