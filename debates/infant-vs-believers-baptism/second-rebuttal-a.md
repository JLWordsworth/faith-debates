# Second Rebuttal: Paedobaptism

## The Jerusalem Council and Covenant Children

My opponent raises an important question about the Jerusalem Council in Acts 15: if infant baptism was apostolic practice, why wasn't it discussed? But this argument actually strengthens the paedobaptist position. The Council addressed whether Gentile converts needed circumcision to be saved. Their decision was clear: circumcision was not required for salvation. Yet they did not conclude that Jewish believers should stop circumcising their infant sons. To this day, Jewish Christians may circumcise their sons as a sign of the Abrahamic covenant, while fully recognizing that circumcision does not save.

The Council abolished circumcision as a *requirement* for inclusion in the covenant community, but it did not abolish the principle of covenant signs for covenant children. If the apostolic church had abandoned the practice of giving covenant signs to children, surely this would have required explicit instruction—especially for Jewish believers who had been circumcising their children for nearly two millennia. The silence of Scripture on abolishing this pattern is telling. When God establishes a pattern of including children in the covenant community, the burden of proof lies on those who would exclude them.

## "The Household Believed": Revisited

My opponent argues that the household baptisms explicitly mention belief. Regarding the Philippian jailer, he notes that the household "rejoiced that they had come to believe in God." But the Greek text literally says they rejoiced that *he* had believed—using the singular verb "pisteusanti." The household rejoiced in the jailer's faith, yet the entire household had been baptized. This is precisely the paedobaptist point: the head of the household believed, and the household received the covenant sign.

Regarding Crispus, Acts 18:8 states that "Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his whole household believed in the Lord." This text does indicate household faith, but it does not exclude infants. A household that believes together includes infants who are brought into the covenant community by the parents' faith—just as Hebrew infants were brought into the covenant by their parents' faith. My opponent assumes that "believing" requires conscious profession, but this imports a modern individualistic understanding into ancient household-oriented texts.

## The Nature of the Sign: What Does Infant Baptism Testify?

My opponent asks what we are testifying about infants when we baptize them. He suggests we are testifying that they are regenerate or members of the new covenant. We are indeed testifying that they are members of the visible covenant community—the church—just as circumcision testified that an infant was a member of the covenant community of Israel. We are *not* testifying that the infant is regenerate or will certainly persevere in faith. Covenant signs have always marked the visible community, which includes both true believers and those who will later prove unfaithful.

Consider circumcision: Ishmael received the sign of the covenant, yet was not a child of promise. Esau was circumcised, yet later despised his birthright. The sign did not guarantee regeneration—it marked covenant membership. Baptism functions similarly. We baptize infants because they are members of the covenant community by virtue of being born to believing parents. We trust God's promise to be "your God and the God of your descendants" (Genesis 17:7), while recognizing that each child must later personally embrace this faith.

## Jesus' Blessing and the Covenant Sign

My opponent notes that Jesus blessed the children but did not baptize them. He suggests that blessing, not baptism, is what we should do with our children. But this overlooks the covenantal context. Jesus lived under the old covenant, during which the covenant sign for children was circumcision. Baptism had not yet been instituted as a covenant sign. After the resurrection, Jesus commissioned baptism as the sign of discipleship for all nations (Matthew 28:19). The children of believing parents are part of "all nations," and there is no indication they are excluded from the commission.

Furthermore, the blessing Jesus pronounced—"Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these"—declared that children have a claim on the kingdom. If the kingdom belongs to them, on what basis do we withhold the kingdom's sign? The sign of the covenant has always marked those who belong to the covenant community.

## The Progressive Nature of Revelation

My opponent asks why there is no explicit example of infant baptism in Scripture. We must remember that progressive revelation often includes implications rather than explicit statements. Scripture never explicitly commands women to partake of the Lord's Supper, yet we rightly include them based on the covenant community principles established. Scripture never explicitly prohibits first cousins from marrying, yet the church rightly deduces this from Levitical law applied to the new covenant community.

The principle of covenant inclusion for children is established throughout Scripture and never revoked. The sign changed from circumcision to baptism, but the pattern of including children remained. The earliest Christians, being Jewish, would have naturally assumed that their children were included in the covenant community unless told otherwise. The absence of explicit instruction to exclude them speaks volumes.

## Conclusion

My opponent's case ultimately rests on requiring explicit faith before the covenant sign. But this reverses the biblical pattern: God always initiates with His people before they can respond. The sign of the covenant marks God's promise, not our response. We baptize infants because we believe God's promise extends to them, we trust His grace to reach them before they can respond, and we acknowledge them as members of the visible covenant community—the church.
