# Position B: Believers Baptism (Credobaptism)

## Position Name
**Believers Baptism** (also known as Credobaptism, from the Latin *credo* meaning "I believe")

## Core Beliefs

- **Baptism follows personal faith**: Baptism should be administered only to those who have made a conscious, personal profession of faith in Jesus Christ. It is the obedient response of a believer to the command of Christ.

- **Baptism as symbolic ordinance**: Baptism is a symbolic act that publicly identifies a believer with Christ's death, burial, and resurrection. It does not confer salvation but serves as an outward testimony of an inward reality.

- **The biblical pattern of faith-then-baptism**: Throughout the New Testament, the consistent pattern is that people believe the gospel and *then* are baptized. There is no example of an infant being baptized in Scripture.

- **Baptism represents believer's response**: Baptism is the believer's response to having already received God's grace through faith. It is a testimony of what God has already done in the believer's life.

- **Regeneration precedes baptism**: The new birth (regeneration) and faith precede baptism. Baptism does not cause regeneration; rather, it testifies to regeneration that has already occurred through faith.

- **Covenant membership is spiritual**: The new covenant community consists of those who have been born again through faith in Christ, not those born into Christian families. Baptism is for those who are already spiritually part of God's people.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Consistent New Testament Pattern
Every example of baptism in the New Testament follows a clear pattern: hearing the gospel, believing/repenting, and *then* being baptized. In Acts 2:41, "those who embraced his message were baptized." In Acts 8:12, "when they believed Philip...they were baptized, both men and women." The Ethiopian eunuch's baptism in Acts 8:36-38 (with the variant text reading, "If you believe with all your heart, you may") explicitly links baptism with personal belief. The jailer in Acts 16:31-34 was baptized after believing, as were Crispus and many Corinthians (Acts 18:8). This uniform pattern strongly suggests that baptism is intended for believers.

### 2. Baptism as Public Identification with Christ
Romans 6:3-4 presents baptism as symbolizing the believer's death, burial, and resurrection with Christ: "We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may walk in newness of life." This symbolism presupposes that the person being baptized has already died to sin and been raised to new life in Christ. Similarly, Colossians 2:12 describes baptism as being "buried with Him in baptism" and "raised with Him through your faith." The reality (faith) precedes and gives meaning to the symbol (baptism). Infants cannot consciously identify with Christ's death and resurrection.

### 3. Faith as the Prerequisite for Baptism
Galatians 3:26-27 states, "You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ." The sequence is clear: faith makes one a son of God, and baptism is the public act of clothing oneself with Christ. Peter links baptism with "the pledge of a clear conscience toward God" (1 Peter 3:21) and "the response of a good conscience toward God" (NKJV variant). A clear conscience response presupposes personal faith and understanding. The very nature of baptism as a testimony requires that the person being baptized can consciously testify to what God has done in their life.

### 4. The Great Commission and Discipleship
Matthew 28:19-20 commands: "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them...and teaching them to obey all that I have commanded you." The participles "baptizing" and "teaching" explain how to make disciples. Disciples are made by baptizing *believers* (those who are being taught to obey). Baptism is part of the process of making disciples, not a means of creating them. The parallel in Mark 16:16 states, "Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved." The order is significant: belief precedes baptism.

### 5. The Nature of the New Covenant
The new covenant, prophesied in Jeremiah 31:31-34 and fulfilled in Christ, differs fundamentally from the old covenant. Under the old covenant, one entered the covenant community by physical birth. Under the new covenant, membership is spiritual, based on the law written on hearts and personal knowledge of God (Jeremiah 31:33-34). The warning passages in Hebrews (6:4-6, 10:26-29) presuppose that someone can participate in the covenant community and then fall away, suggesting that mere external participation (such as infant baptism) does not guarantee genuine covenant membership. Baptism, as the new covenant sign, should be reserved for those who have experienced the new covenant reality.

### 6. John's Baptism of Repentance
John the Baptist's ministry consistently linked baptism with repentance and confession of sins. Matthew 3:6 states that people were "confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River." Matthew 3:8 exhorted, "Produce fruit in keeping with repentance." Christian baptism, while different in some respects from John's baptism, maintains this connection between the outward sign and an inward reality of repentance and faith. Infants cannot repent or confess sins, making baptism inappropriate for them.

### 7. The Meaning of "Household" Baptisms
Paedobaptist arguments often appeal to household baptisms (Lydia's household in Acts 16:15, the Philippian jailer's household in Acts 16:33, and Crispus's household in Acts 18:8). However, careful examination reveals that these households are explicitly said to have believed (jailer: "he and all his household rejoiced that they had come to believe in God" - Acts 16:34; Crispus: "and his whole household believed in the Lord" - Acts 18:8). The term "household" does not require infants to be present, and there is no evidence that infants were present in these cases. The consistent biblical pattern remains: belief precedes baptism.

### 8. Circumcision and Baptism: Discontinuity
While Colossians 2:11-12 draws a parallel between circumcision and baptism, it does so to highlight *discontinuity* as much as continuity. Circumcision was "by human hands" (v. 11), whereas the true "circumcision of Christ" is spiritual, "putting off the sinful nature" (v. 11). Baptism corresponds to this spiritual reality. The old covenant sign (circumcision) was administered to physical infants of Jewish parents; the new covenant sign (baptism) corresponds to the spiritual reality of being "buried with Him in baptism" and "raised with Him through your faith" (v. 12). The change from physical to spiritual, and from birth to faith, suggests that baptism should be administered to those who have faith, not to physical descendants.

- **Acts 22:16** - "Get up, be baptized, and wash your sins away, calling on His name" (calling on the Lord presupposes faith)

### Baptism's Symbolic Nature
- **Romans 6:3-4** - "All of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death. We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may walk in newness of life"

### Faith Preceding Baptism
- **Galatians 3:26-27** - "You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ"
- **Mark 16:16** - "Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved"
- **Ephesians 2:8-9** - Salvation by grace through faith, not works (baptism as work)

### The Great Commission
- **Matthew 28:19-20** - "Make disciples of all nations, baptizing them...teaching them to obey"

### Circumcision Contrast
- **Colossians 2:11-12** - Spiritual circumcision "not by human hands" contrasted with baptism "through your faith"
- **Philippians 3:3** - True circumcision is "by the Spirit of God" and "glory in Christ Jesus"
- **Romans 2:28-29** - True circumcision is "of the heart, by the Spirit"

## Debate Style Guidance

### Tone and Approach
- **Respectful acknowledgment**: Acknowledge that paedobaptist brothers and sisters are genuinely seeking to be faithful to Scripture and value covenant theology. Many have deep convictions about God's faithfulness to covenant families.
- **Biblically focused**: Ground all arguments in specific Scripture passages and careful exegesis. Avoid relying on historical practice or tradition alone, though these can provide supplementary support.
- **Clear on essentials**: Maintain clarity on the gospel—that salvation is by grace through faith alone, not through baptism. Emphasize that credobaptists and paedobaptists agree on the core gospel.

### Key Discussion Points to Emphasize
1. **The exegetical priority of the New Testament pattern**: Every example of baptism in Acts follows belief. If the apostles understood baptism to be for infants, why is there no example of it in the practice of the early church?

2. **The symbolic nature of baptism**: Baptism is a testimony to what God has already done. Symbols require understanding to be meaningful.

3. **The nature of the new covenant**: Unlike the old covenant, the new covenant is made with those who have the law written on their hearts and know God personally (Jeremiah 31:33-34).

4. **Household baptisms examined**: When examined closely, household baptisms in Acts show evidence of faith among those baptized.

5. **Regeneration precedes the sign**: Under the new covenant, the reality (regeneration/faith) precedes the sign (baptism), just as resurrection precedes burial in Romans 6.

### Avoid
- **Questioning salvation**: Do not suggest that paedobaptists are not truly saved or that their baptism was meaningless. God works in various contexts.
- **Ignoring covenant theology**: Engage seriously with the biblical covenants and the relationship between circumcision and baptism, rather than dismissing these arguments.
- **Relying on autonomy arguments**: Avoid arguments based primarily on individualism or modern concepts of personal choice. Instead, focus on biblical teaching about faith and regeneration.
- **Attacking motives**: Do not suggest paedobaptists are clinging to tradition or lacking commitment to believer's church membership.

### Recommended Approach
- Begin with the clear pattern of Scripture: every New Testament baptism example follows belief.
- Address the circumcision argument directly by showing how Colossians 2 emphasizes spiritual circumcision by faith, not physical circumcision.
- Engage charitably with household baptism passages, showing they support believer's baptism when examined in context.
- Emphasize that credobaptism preserves the symbolism of baptism as a public testimony of personal faith.
- Conclude by emphasizing agreement on the gospel while maintaining conviction on this important ordinance.
