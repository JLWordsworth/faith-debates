# First Rebuttal: Believers Baptism (Credobaptism)

## Response to the Circumcision-Baptism Argument

My opponent has rightly identified Colossians 2:11-12 as a crucial passage. However, I believe this text, when examined carefully, actually supports believer's baptism rather than infant baptism. Paul writes: "In Him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of the sinful nature, with the circumcision performed by Christ and not by human hands. And having been buried with Him in baptism, you were raised with Him through your faith in the power of God."

Notice what Paul emphasizes: circumcision "not by human hands" and being "raised with Him through your faith." The old circumcision was physical, performed by human hands on eight-day-old infants regardless of their faith. The new "circumcision of Christ" is spiritual—a putting off of the sinful nature that comes through faith. Baptism corresponds to this spiritual reality, not the physical rite. The parallel exists, but it demonstrates *discontinuity* as much as continuity: we moved from a physical sign administered to physical infants to a spiritual sign corresponding to spiritual circumcision that comes "through your faith."

This is why the sign changed from circumcision to baptism. The old covenant was physical and ethnic—you entered by physical birth. The new covenant is spiritual—you enter by spiritual birth. As Jesus told Nicodemus, "Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit" (John 3:6). The new covenant community consists of those born "not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God" (John 1:13).

## The Nature of Covenant Inclusion

My opponent rightly notes that God's promises extend to children, and we agree wholeheartedly that children of believers are special in God's sight. But we must ask: what does Acts 2:39 mean when it says "the promise is for you and your children"? In the very same verse, Peter continues: "and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call." The promise is for children, but it's also for "all who are far off"—Gentiles! Yet we wouldn't baptize all Gentiles indiscriminately. The promise is for all whom God calls, and the question is: how do we recognize those who are called? Through their response of faith.

The Abrahamic covenant included physical descendants, but Paul makes clear in Galatians 3 that the true children of Abraham are those who believe: "Understand, then, that those who believe are children of Abraham" (Galatians 3:7). "If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise" (Galatians 3:29). Physical descent no longer determines covenant membership—faith does. This is the radical shift the new covenant brings.

## Examining the Household Baptisms

My opponent appeals to household baptisms in Acts, suggesting infants may have been included. Let's examine these texts carefully. Lydia's household was baptized after "the Lord opened her heart to respond" (Acts 16:14-15). The Philippian jailer was told "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household." Then Luke tells us he was baptized immediately, and "he and all his household rejoiced that they had come to believe in God" (Acts 16:31-34). Notice: the household rejoiced *that they had come to believe*. How can infants rejoice that they have believed?

Crispus's household: "Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his whole household believed in the Lord" (Acts 18:8). The household believed. The household of Stephanas (1 Corinthians 1:16) Paul calls "the first converts in Achaia" (1 Corinthians 16:15)—they had personally turned to God.

The term "household" (oikos) in these contexts doesn't require infants to be present, and more importantly, the texts explicitly mention belief among those baptized. The consistent pattern remains.

## Grace Does Precede Faith—but Does Baptism Convey That Grace?

My opponent argues that infant baptism beautifully illustrates that grace precedes faith. We agree entirely that grace precedes faith—Ephesians 2:8-9 makes clear that even our faith is a gift of God's grace. But the question is: does baptism convey grace, or does it testify to grace already received?

If grace precedes faith, and baptism testifies to grace received through faith, then requiring faith before baptism in no way undermines grace. God's grace reached us long before we came to faith. He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world (Ephesians 1:4). Christ died for us while we were still sinners (Romans 5:8). Grace precedes faith indeed—but baptism celebrates and testifies to that grace after we have received it through faith.

Consider Romans 6:3-4 again: we are buried with Christ through baptism "in order that...we too may walk in newness of life." The walking in newness life—sanctification—follows the symbolism. But the presupposition is that the person has already died to sin and been raised to new life. How can someone symbolically portray what they haven't experienced?

## Jesus and the Children

My opponent appeals to Jesus blessing the children (Matthew 19:14). We love this passage and fully affirm Jesus' welcome of children. But Jesus did not baptize these children—He blessed them. He placed His hands on them and prayed for them. This is precisely what we do with our children: we dedicate them to the Lord, pray for them, teach them the Scriptures, and trust God's promise to be gracious to them. But blessing is not baptism. The text gives no warrant for infant baptism.

## The Silence of Scripture

Here's a question we must grapple with: if infant baptism was the apostolic practice, why is there not a single example of it in Scripture? Why does every recorded baptism follow a profession of faith? Why are there no instructions about how to handle infants in baptism, no discussions about whether to baptize children of believers, no controversies about it in the early church?

The Jerusalem Council in Acts 15 dealt with the question of who belongs to the people of God. The issue was whether Gentiles needed to be circumcised. If baptism replaced circumcision as the sign for covenant children, surely this would have been discussed. Yet the council said nothing about baptism—they concluded that Gentiles did not need circumcision. The old sign was abolished, not replaced with a new version for infants.

## A Final Thought on the Gospel

We must be careful not to confuse the sign with the reality. Salvation comes by grace through faith alone, not through baptism. My opponent and I agree on this crucial gospel truth. But if we baptize infants who have not believed, what are we testifying about them? That they are regenerate? That they are members of the new covenant community? Yet Hebrews warns that those who have been "enlightened" and "tasted the heavenly gift" can still fall away (Hebrews 6:4-6). External signs without internal reality provide no guarantee.

Baptism testifies to what God has done. Let us reserve this beautiful testimony for those who can say with integrity: "I have believed; here I stand, identified with Christ."
