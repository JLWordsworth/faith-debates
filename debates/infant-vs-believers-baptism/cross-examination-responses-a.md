# Cross-Examination Responses - Paedobaptism

## Response to Question 1: Jeremiah 31 and Knowing the Lord

You raise an important point about Jeremiah 31:34 describing a covenant where all know the Lord, from least to greatest. However, this passage describes the *ideal* of the new covenant in its eschatological fulfillment, not the present visible reality of the church. Even among adult believers today, we do not all know the Lord fully—"we see in a mirror dimly" (1 Corinthians 13:12). The warning passages of Hebrews (6:4-6, 10:26-31) presuppose that some within the covenant community can fall away, demonstrating that not all who are part of the visible new covenant community truly know the Lord.

Furthermore, the contrast in Jeremiah 31 is not between including and excluding children, but between a covenant written externally on stone and one written internally on hearts. The new covenant brings greater spiritual reality to the covenant community, but this does not mean it excludes those who have not yet attained conscious faith. The "they will all know Me" language is figurative, expressing the pervasiveness of true knowledge under the new covenant, similar to how "all Israel" language often included children even when not every individual truly knew the Lord.

## Response to Question 2: The Sign and Seal Question

You correctly note that Abraham possessed righteousness by faith before receiving circumcision. However, Romans 4:11 says circumcision was "a sign and seal of the righteousness that he had *by faith* while still uncircumcised." The sign pointed backward to the righteousness Abraham already possessed, but it was also given to his children—including Isaac, who received circumcision at eight days old before possessing conscious faith.

The sign functioned in two ways: for those with conscious faith (like Abraham), it sealed their existing righteousness; for covenant children (like Isaac), it marked God's covenant promise that they would be raised in the faith and called to personally embrace it. Circumcision did not confer faith or regeneration—it marked covenant membership. Similarly, infant baptism does not confer regeneration but marks the child's membership in the covenant community and God's promise to be their God. The sign points to God's gracious initiative, not the child's subjective experience.

## Response to Question 3: The Silence of Acts

You note that Acts records no explicit infant baptisms and that the Jerusalem Council did not discuss the topic. However, this silence is precisely what we would expect if the apostolic church continued the Old Testament pattern of including children in the covenant community. The first Christians were Jewish, and for 2,000 years their people had been giving covenant signs to infants. There was no controversy about this because no one was teaching that children should be excluded—just as there is no record of Jesus' disciples debating whether children should be allowed to come to Him. The absence of controversy reflects continuity, not change.

Regarding the Jerusalem Council: the issue was whether Gentile converts needed circumcision to be *saved*. The Council ruled that circumcision was not required for salvation. But this does not address whether Jewish believers should continue circumcising their children, nor does it address whether there is a new covenant sign for covenant children. The Council abolished the requirement of circumcision for inclusion, not the principle of covenant signs for children.

The Acts narratives consistently record baptisms of converts because that is Luke's purpose—documenting the spread of the gospel to new converts. The fact that he does not record the baptism of existing children when households came to faith does not prove it didn't happen; it only proves that Luke focused on the conversion of the household head. The household baptism language, combined with the Old Testament pattern, provides sufficient warrant for believing children were included.
