# Cross-Examination Responses - Debater B (Believers Baptism)

## Response to Question 1: The Holiness of Believers' Children

This is an excellent question that deserves careful attention. Paul's description of children as "holy" (hagia) in 1 Corinthians 7:14 is significant, but we must understand it in context. Paul is addressing the question of whether believing spouses should divorce unbelieving spouses. He argues that the unbelieving spouse is "sanctified" (hiazetai) through the believing one, and therefore the marriage is legitimate and the children are "holy" rather than "unclean."

The parallel terms—"sanctified" for the spouse and "holy" for the children—suggest this is about legitimate status within a mixed marriage, not about covenant membership or regeneration. In the same epistle, Paul distinguishes between those who are "carnal" (sarkikos) and "spiritual" (pneumatikos)—a distinction relevant to understanding "holiness" here. The children's "holiness" means they are set apart in a special position due to having believing parent(s), not that they are regenerate members of the new covenant community.

This is precisely why we dedicate our children to the Lord, pray for them faithfully, teach them the Scriptures, and trust God's promise to be gracious to them. They are in a privileged position. But being in a privileged position is different from being eligible for baptism, which as Romans 6:3-4 and Colossians 2:12 make clear, testifies to having died with Christ and being raised through faith. The children are "holy" in the sense of being set apart for God's special care—they should be dedicated, not baptized.

## Response to Question 2: The "Better" Covenant and Covenant Children

The question assumes that "better" must mean "more inclusive of those who cannot yet believe." But Hebrews 8:6 explains *why* the new covenant is better: it is "enacted on better promises" and includes the law written on hearts and personal knowledge of God (Hebrews 8:10-12, quoting Jeremiah 31:33-34). The "betterness" is precisely that it consists of those who truly know the Lord, not a mixed community like Israel.

Under the old covenant, infants received the sign because they were born into the physical people of God. But that physical community included many who were not truly God's people—"not all who are descended from Israel are Israel" (Romans 9:6). The new covenant is better precisely because it consists of the true Israel—those born "not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God" (John 1:13).

As for Gentiles being "brought near" (Ephesians 2:13), Paul immediately explains this is by faith: "for through Him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit" (Ephesians 2:18). The inclusion of Gentiles demonstrates that *anyone* who believes can be part of God's people—not that faith is now optional. It is "better" that the sign belongs to those who have the reality (regeneration through faith) rather than being given to those who lack the reality (physical infants).

The child of believing parents today is in a *better* position than the Jewish infant of old. The Jewish infant received a physical sign marking physical membership in a community that included many unregenerate members. The child of believers today has believing parents who will teach them the gospel, pray for them, bring them to church, and trust God's grace to bring them to faith. They are "holy" (1 Corinthians 7:14) and in a privileged position—but the sign of the new covenant awaits their personal faith, precisely because the new covenant consists of those who know the Lord.

## Response to Question 3: The Absence of an Exclusion Command

This question reverses the burden of proof. The apostles were Jewish Christians who had practiced circumcision for their infant sons. When they preached the gospel, they baptized converts—every single one of whom had believed. If they intended to continue giving covenant signs to infants, we would expect them to do so with the Jewish converts who came to faith.

Consider the situation at Pentecost. Peter preached to Jews, and "those who embraced his message were baptized" (Acts 2:41). These were Jewish people, many of whom would have been circumcised as infants and would have had infants of their own. If baptism replaced circumcision for covenant children, this was the perfect opportunity to say so. Instead, Luke specifically notes that "those who embraced his message were baptized"—no mention of their infants being baptized.

Similarly, when the Jerusalem Council debated whether Gentile converts needed circumcision (Acts 15), the conclusion was that Gentiles did not need circumcision at all. If baptism replaced circumcision for infants, this would have been the context to address it: "Gentiles don't need circumcision, but baptize your infants." Yet this is entirely absent.

More significantly, the early church was composed of Jewish Christians who had known only infant inclusion for 2,000 years. If the apostles *discontinued* this practice without explicit instruction, we would expect confusion, controversy, or questions. Yet no New Testament epistle addresses what to do with believers' children regarding baptism—no instruction to baptize them, no instruction not to, no controversy. Why?

Perhaps because the answer was obvious: the apostolic pattern was belief-then-baptism. The first Christians, seeing that every baptism in Scripture followed belief, understood that this was the Christian practice. No one needed to be told "don't baptize your infants" because no one was doing so—they followed the pattern of belief-then-baptism they saw in Acts.

The first explicit mention of infant baptism doesn't appear until Tertullian (early 3rd century), who actually *opposed* it. Irenaeus (late 2nd century) may allude to it, but the evidence is ambiguous. The earliest clear evidence of infant baptism appears in the 3rd century. This suggests that infant baptism developed as a later practice, not as apostolic teaching. The burden of proof lies with those claiming a practice not found in Scripture—and that proof is lacking.
