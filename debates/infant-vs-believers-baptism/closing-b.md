# Closing Statement: Believers Baptism (Credobaptism)

## The Biblical Pattern Stands Unanswered

Throughout this debate, one fact remains uncontested and unanswerable: every single example of baptism in the New Testament follows a clear pattern of belief, repentance, or confession preceding baptism. From Pentecost to the Ethiopian eunuch, from Lydia's household to the Philippian jailer, from Crispus to the Corinthians—Luke records approximately 12-15 specific baptism narratives spanning 30 years of early church history, and in every instance, baptism follows faith.

My opponent argues that household baptisms may have included infants, but when examined closely, these texts explicitly mention belief among those baptized. The Philippian jailer's household "rejoiced that they had come to believe in God." Crispus's household "believed in the Lord." The household of Stephanas were "the first converts in Achaia." The consistent pattern remains.

But the more telling evidence is what we don't find. If infant baptism was apostolic practice, why is there no example of it? Why did Luke record every instance of believers being baptized but omit any example of infants being baptized? Why did the Jerusalem Council—debating the fundamental question of who belongs to God's people and whether Gentiles needed circumcision—never address whether covenant children should be baptized? The silence is deafening, and my opponent has not adequately explained it.

## The Symbolism Requires Faith

Romans 6:3-4 presents baptism as symbolizing the believer's death, burial, and resurrection with Christ: "We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may walk in newness of life." This symbolism presupposes that the person being baptized has already died to sin and been raised to new life. Colossians 2:12 makes this even clearer: we are "raised with Him through your faith." The reality—faith—precedes and gives meaning to the symbol.

My opponent suggests that baptism, like circumcision, is a "sign and seal" of God's covenant promise. But notice what Romans 4:11 actually says: circumcision was a sign of the righteousness Abraham *already possessed by faith*. Abraham believed, was counted righteous, and *then* received circumcision as a sign of what he already possessed. The sign marked an existing reality, not a future promise.

When we baptize infants who have not believed, what reality are we sealing? What are we testifying about them? That they are regenerate? That they are members of the new covenant community? Yet Hebrews warns that those who have participated in the covenant community can still fall away. External signs without internal reality provide no guarantee.

## The New Covenant Consists of Those Who Know God

My opponent argues that the new covenant, being "better," should be more inclusive of children than the old. But Jeremiah 31:31-34 explicitly contrasts the new covenant with the old by stating that under the new covenant, "No longer will each man teach his neighbor or his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' because they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest." The old covenant included many who did not know the Lord; the new covenant consists exclusively of those who do.

The new covenant community is not defined by physical birth but by spiritual rebirth. As Jesus told Nicodemus, "Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit" (John 3:6). The true children of Abraham are those who believe (Galatians 3:7, 29). Physical descent no longer determines covenant membership—faith does.

My opponent appealed to 1 Corinthians 7:14, where Paul calls children of believers "holy." But this is about their privileged status in having believing parents, not about covenant membership or regeneration. We dedicate our children to the Lord, pray for them, teach them the Scriptures, and trust God's promise to be gracious to them. They are "holy" in this sense—set apart for God's special care. But baptism, as a testimony of personal faith, awaits their personal faith.

## A Final Appeal

My opponent and I agree on what matters most: salvation is by grace through faith alone, not by works including baptism. We both want to see children come to faith in Christ. We both trust God's grace to our children.

The question is: what does Scripture teach about baptism?

- Every example in Acts shows baptism following belief
- Every theological explanation of baptism presupposes faith
- The symbolism requires someone who has died to sin and been raised to new life
- The new covenant consists of those who know the Lord
- The sign should mark those who belong to the covenant community

I believe Scripture teaches that baptism is the believer's first act of obedient response to Christ—a public testimony that "I have believed, and I am identifying with Christ's death and resurrection." This beautiful testimony should be reserved for those who can say this with integrity.

To my worthy opponent: I appreciate your sincerity, your love for Scripture, and your desire to honor God by claiming His promises for your children. We serve the same Lord, and we will worship Him together in heaven. On this matter, I must respectfully—but charitably—disagree. Let us continue to study Scripture together, trusting that God's Word is our final authority.
