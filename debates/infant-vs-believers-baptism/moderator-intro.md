# Debate Topic: Infant vs Believers Baptism

## Overview

This debate addresses one of the most significant practical and theological differences among Christian traditions: Who should be baptized? Should baptism be administered to the infant children of believing parents, or only to those who have made a conscious personal profession of faith in Jesus Christ?

This question touches on fundamental issues including: the nature of the new covenant, the relationship between Old Testament circumcision and New Testament baptism, the meaning of baptism itself, and how we understand God's covenant promises to families.

## Position A: Paedobaptism (Infant Baptism)

Paedobaptism holds that baptism is the New Testament sign of the covenant community, analogous to circumcision in the Old Testament. Children of believing parents are included in the covenant of grace and should therefore receive the covenant sign of baptism. Baptism signifies God's gracious initiative toward us before we can respond in faith, though children must later personally affirm their faith through confirmation. This position emphasizes covenant continuity, household inclusion, and the pattern of God's promises extending to believers and their children throughout Scripture.

## Position B: Credobaptism (Believers Baptism)

Credobaptism holds that baptism should be administered only to those who have made a conscious, personal profession of faith in Jesus Christ. Baptism is a symbolic ordinance that publicly identifies a believer with Christ's death, burial, and resurrection. It does not confer salvation but serves as an outward testimony of an inward reality that has already occurred through faith. This position emphasizes the consistent New Testament pattern of faith preceding baptism, the symbolic nature of the ordinance, and the spiritual nature of new covenant membership.
