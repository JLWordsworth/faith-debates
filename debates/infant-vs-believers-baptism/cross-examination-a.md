# Cross-Examination Questions for Debater B

## Question 1: The Nature of the Covenant Community

You argue that the new covenant community consists only of those who have consciously believed, based on passages like John 1:13 ("born of God") and John 3:6 ("Spirit gives birth to spirit"). However, the apostle Paul addresses the children of believers as "holy" in 1 Corinthians 7:14: "For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his believing wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy."

If only consciously regenerates believers are members of the new covenant community, in what meaningful sense can Paul describe the children of even one believing parent as "holy"? And if children are "holy" and not "unclean," what biblical basis exists for withholding the covenant sign from those whom Scripture explicitly set apart as holy?

## Question 2: The Discontinuity Problem

You argue that Colossians 2:11-12 demonstrates discontinuity between the old and new covenants—that we moved from a physical sign for physical infants to a spiritual sign corresponding to spiritual circumcision that comes "through faith." However, this creates a significant theological problem: the new covenant is described as "better" and "more excellent" than the old (Hebrews 8:6), and Gentiles who were once "aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise" have now been "brought near" (Ephesians 2:12).

If the new covenant is better and more inclusive, and Gentiles who were formerly excluded have been brought near rather than pushed farther away, how does excluding covenant children from receiving the covenant sign represent an advancement? How is it "better" for a child to have no covenant sign until they can articulate faith, compared to receiving the sign of God's promise from infancy as Abraham's children did?

## Question 3: The Absence of Exclusion Command

You emphasize that Scripture never explicitly records an infant being baptized, and that every recorded baptism follows a profession of faith. However, the first Christians were predominantly Jewish, and for nearly 2,000 years, Jewish families had been giving the covenant sign to their infants. The pattern was deeply established.

If the apostles intended to abolish this ancient practice of giving covenant signs to children, why is there no record of any instruction to that effect? Why does no New Testament epistle address the question of what to do with the children of believers, or command believers to stop giving them the covenant sign? When major changes were made to covenant practice—such as ending circumcision requirements—they were explicitly addressed (Acts 15, Galatians). The silence on excluding children from the covenant sign seems significant given how deeply embedded this practice was in Jewish life. How do you account for this absence?
