# Closing Statement: Paedobaptism

## The Covenant Pattern: God's Grace to Families

Throughout this debate, I have argued that infant baptism is the New Testament application of an ancient biblical pattern: God's covenant promises extend to believers and their children. From Genesis to Revelation, Scripture consistently presents God as dealing with families, not merely isolated individuals. To Abraham, God promised, "I will establish My covenant as an everlasting covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you" (Genesis 17:7). At Pentecost, Peter declared, "The promise is for you and your children" (Acts 2:39). This thread runs through redemptive history, and the new covenant—described as "better" and "more excellent" than the old—does not reverse this pattern. It fulfills it.

My opponent has argued that baptism must always follow conscious profession because every recorded baptism in Acts follows this sequence. But this reasoning assumes that Luke's purpose was to provide a comprehensive manual on baptism, rather than to document the spread of the gospel. The household baptisms he records—Lydia, the Philippian jailer, Crispus, Stephanas—are consistent with both positions. What distinguishes our positions is whether we see the new covenant as including or excluding the children of believers. The silence of Scripture on excluding them, combined with 2,000 years of Jewish practice giving covenant signs to infants, suggests continuity rather than change.

## Grace Precedes Faith: The Heart of the Gospel

The heart of the paedobaptist position is that grace precedes faith. God reaches out to us before we can respond. He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world (Ephesians 1:4). He died for us while we were still sinners (Romans 5:8). And He extends His covenant promises to our children before they can consciously believe. Infant baptism testifies to this gracious initiative. It declares that salvation is God's work, not human achievement—that He claims us before we can claim Him.

My opponent has expressed concern that baptizing infants confuses the sign with the reality or implies that baptism saves. But paedobaptists have always affirmed that salvation is by grace through faith alone, not by baptism. We baptize infants not because we believe they are already regenerate, but because we trust God's promise to be their God and the God of their descendants. We recognize that each child must later personally embrace this faith, just as Isaac circumcised at eight days old was called to live out his covenant identity.

## A Better Covenant with Broader Grace

The credobaptist position, while sincerely held, inadvertently narrows the scope of God's gracious covenant dealings. By restricting baptism to those who can articulate faith, it effectively excludes covenant children from the visible covenant community until they can demonstrate mature belief. Yet Scripture calls the children of even one believing parent "holy" (1 Corinthians 7:14). Jesus declared that the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these (Matthew 19:14). If the kingdom belongs to them, and they are called holy, on what biblical basis do we withhold the kingdom's sign?

The new covenant is indeed better than the old—not because it excludes some whom the old included, but because it brings the reality to which the old pointed. The new covenant is more inclusive, not less. Gentiles who were once "strangers to the covenants of promise" have been "brought near" (Ephesians 2:12). The blessing of Abraham has come to the nations (Galatians 3:14). This expansion of grace should lead us to include children in the covenant community, not exclude them.

## Conclusion: A Gracious Promise

I have appreciated this opportunity to discuss these matters with my worthy opponent, and I respect his sincere desire to preserve the purity of the gospel. We agree on the essentials: salvation is by grace through faith alone, Christ alone; baptism does not save; and all true believers will personally profess faith in Christ. Our disagreement is not about the gospel, but about the breadth of God's covenant promises and the proper subjects of baptism.

The paedobaptist position rests on a continuous thread of biblical teaching: God's covenant embraces families, His promises extend to children, and His grace reaches out before we can respond. Infant baptism beautifully embodies these truths. It declares to our children from their earliest days: "You are loved by God. You belong to His people. His promises are for you." And it calls the church to take seriously its responsibility to nurture these children in the faith, trusting that the God who began this good work in them will bring it to completion at the day of Christ Jesus.

May God be glorified as we seek to be faithful to His Word, and may His grace abound to all our children as they grow in the knowledge and love of our Lord Jesus Christ.
