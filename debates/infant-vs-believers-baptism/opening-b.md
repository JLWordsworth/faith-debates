# Opening Statement: Believers Baptism (Credobaptism)

## Core Thesis

Baptism is a beautiful ordinance ordained by Christ, but Scripture consistently presents it as a response to faith—not a means of entering the covenant community. Throughout the New Testament, the pattern is unmistakable: people hear the gospel, believe, repent, and *then* are baptized. This isn't merely a historical coincidence; it reflects the very nature of the new covenant, where God's people are defined not by physical birth but by spiritual rebirth through faith in Christ.

## The Biblical Pattern: Faith Precedes Baptism

Every recorded baptism in the book of Acts follows this same sequence. On the day of Pentecost, Peter commanded, "Repent and be baptized," and Luke tells us "those who embraced his message were baptized" (Acts 2:38, 41). When Philip preached in Samaria, "when they believed Philip...they were baptized, both men and women" (Acts 8:12). Notice the explicit mention that men and women were baptized—no infants. The Ethiopian eunuch, upon hearing the gospel, asked, "What prevents me from being baptized?" Philip's reply in the earliest manuscripts was straightforward: "If you believe with all your heart, you may" (Acts 8:37). The Philippian jailer was told, "Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved," and then "he and all his household rejoiced that they had come to believe in God" before being baptized (Acts 16:31-34). This uniform pattern cannot be dismissed as accidental. It reflects the apostolic understanding of baptism as the believer's first act of obedience to Christ.

## Baptism as Symbolic Testimony

Paul explains the meaning of baptism in Romans 6:3-4: "We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may walk in newness of life." This symbolism presupposes that the person being baptized has already died to sin and been raised to new life in Christ. Baptism testifies to a reality that already exists. Similarly, Colossians 2:12 speaks of being "buried with Him in baptism" and "raised with Him through your faith." Notice—raised *through your faith*. The reality of faith precedes and gives meaning to the symbol. Peter calls baptism "the pledge of a clear conscience toward God" (1 Peter 3:21). How can an infant pledge a clear conscience? How can someone who hasn't yet experienced death to sin and new life in Christ symbolically portray that which they haven't experienced?

## The Nature of the New Covenant

The old and new covenants operate on fundamentally different principles. Under the old covenant, one entered the covenant community by physical birth. Circumcision was administered to eight-day-old infants because they were born into the people of Israel. But Jeremiah prophesied a new covenant where God would put His law "within them" and write it "on their hearts" (Jeremiah 31:33). Membership would no longer be determined by physical descent but by personal knowledge of God. The warning passages in Hebrews presuppose that someone can participate in the covenant community outwardly and yet fall away—suggesting that external signs without internal reality provide no guarantee. Baptism, as the new covenant sign, belongs to those who have experienced the new covenant reality: regeneration through faith.

## What I Will Argue

In this debate, I will demonstrate that:

1. **The New Testament pattern of faith-then-baptism is normative, not accidental**. Every example, command, and theological explanation of baptism in Scripture presupposes personal faith.

2. **Baptism is symbolic, not sacramental, in nature**. It testifies to what God has already done through faith, not a means of conveying grace.

3. **Household baptisms, when examined carefully, support believer's baptism**. The texts explicitly mention belief in these households.

4. **The circumcision-baptism parallel actually supports credobaptism**. Colossians 2 emphasizes spiritual circumcision "not by human hands" and baptism "through your faith"—the reality is spiritual and comes through faith.

5. **The gospel itself is at stake in preserving baptism as a response to faith**. We must not confuse the sign with the reality, nor add requirements to the simple gospel message: salvation by grace through faith alone.

I appreciate my paedobaptist brothers and sisters and their desire to claim God's promises for their children. We agree on the gospel—that salvation is by grace through faith alone, not by works, including baptism. But I believe Scripture teaches that baptism, as a public testimony of that faith, belongs to those who have personally believed. The symbol should follow the reality, not precede it.
