# First Rebuttal: Paedobaptism

## Clarifying the Nature of the Covenant Signs

My worthy opponent has presented a thoughtful case for believer's baptism, emphasizing the pattern of faith preceding baptism in Acts. I appreciate his commitment to preserving the gospel of grace. However, I believe his position misunderstands the nature of baptism as a covenant sign and overlooks important continuities between the covenants.

He correctly notes that Romans 6 and Colossians 2 speak of baptism symbolizing death and resurrection with Christ. But he assumes this symbolism requires the baptized person to have already experienced this reality consciously. This is precisely where the difference lies: baptism is not merely a symbol of our faith, but a sign and seal of God's covenant promise. Romans 4:11 describes circumcision as a "sign and seal" of righteousness that Abraham possessed *by faith*. The sign marked the reality of God's covenant, not Abraham's subjective experience of it. Similarly, infant baptism testifies to God's gracious promise to covenant children, not to their conscious faith.

## The Acts Narratives: Household Baptisms Reconsidered

My opponent argues that every baptism in Acts follows a pattern of belief preceding baptism. But consider the household baptisms he briefly mentioned. When the Philippian jailer was told, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household," Luke reports that "he was baptized at once, he and all his family" (Acts 16:33). Notice the sequence: the promise to the household, then the baptism, then the statement that "he rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God" (Acts 16:34). The household rejoiced that *he*—the jailer—had believed, yet the entire household had been baptized. The text does not specify that every member made a profession of faith, nor does it exclude the presence of children.

Similarly, Paul says he baptized "the household of Stephanas" (1 Corinthians 1:16). Later, he describes this household as "the first converts in Achaia" and those who "devoted themselves to the service of the saints" (1 Corinthians 16:15). This language of a household being devoted to service is consistent with Old Testament covenant language about households. The New Testament does not explicitly exclude children from these household baptisms, and given the Old Testament pattern of household inclusion, the burden of proof lies with those who would claim children were excluded.

## The New Covenant: More Inclusive, Not Less

My opponent argues that the new covenant operates on different principles than the old, with membership determined by spiritual rebirth rather than physical birth. I agree that the new covenant brings greater spiritual realities, but this does not mean it is less inclusive of children. To the contrary, the new covenant is described as "better" and "more excellent" (Hebrews 8:6). If the Old Covenant included infants as covenant members, how could the "better" covenant exclude them?

The warning passages in Hebrews do not prove that only the regenerate should receive the covenant sign. Under the Old Covenant, Esau and Ishmael received circumcision despite never being part of the true spiritual Israel. Covenant signs have always marked the visible covenant community, which includes both true believers and those who will later prove unfaithful. Baptism, like circumcision, marks membership in the visible covenant community—the church—not a guarantee of election.

## Jesus and the Kingdom Belonging to Children

My opponent emphasizes that the new covenant community is defined by spiritual rebirth, yet he does not address Jesus' explicit teaching about children. When Jesus said, "Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these" (Matthew 19:14), He was not merely speaking metaphorically. He was asserting that children have a claim on the kingdom. If the kingdom belongs to them, on what basis do we withhold the kingdom's sign from them?

Furthermore, my opponent argues that we must not "add requirements to the simple gospel message." But paedobaptists do not believe baptism saves; we believe it is a means of grace that strengthens faith, not a requirement for salvation. We agree that salvation is by grace through faith alone. The question is whether the sign of the covenant should be given to the children of believers, as circumcision was under the Old Covenant.

## Conclusion

My opponent's case rests on the assumption that baptism must always follow conscious profession. But this assumes without proof that baptism is primarily a symbol of our faith rather than a sign of God's covenant promise. Scripture presents baptism as both: a symbol of our union with Christ *and* a sign and seal of God's covenant promises to us and our children. The pattern of household baptisms, the continuity between circumcision and baptism, Jesus' welcome of children, and the covenant promises to families all support the inclusion of children in the covenant sign of baptism.
