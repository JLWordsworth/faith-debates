# Cross-Examination Questions for Debater A

## Question 1

You argue that the desert fathers' withdrawal was preparation rather than escape, but how do you reconcile this with the Great Commission's mandate to "go and make disciples of all nations"? When Anthony the Great and others deliberately removed themselves from population centers for decades, weren't they effectively abdicating their responsibility to engage actively with the world Christ came to save?

## Question 2

You cite the desert fathers' influence on monasticism as evidence of their enduring relevance, but doesn't this merely demonstrate institutional success rather than spiritual legitimacy? The same logic could be applied to any movement that gained followers—including ones you would likely reject as heretical. What objective biblical standard allows us to distinguish between their historical impact and actual spiritual faithfulness?

## Question 3

You emphasize the value of their ascetic practices for modern spiritual formation, but how do you address the serious concerns about gnostic-influenced dualism that runs through much of desert spirituality? When the desert fathers consistently frame the body as an enemy to be conquered rather than a redeemed aspect of human nature to be stewarded, aren't they fundamentally departing from the biblical vision of embodied resurrection and the goodness of creation?
