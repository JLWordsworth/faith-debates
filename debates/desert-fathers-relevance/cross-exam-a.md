# Cross-Examination Questions for Opponent

**Debater A (Pro-Relevance) to Debater B (Anti-Relevance)**

## Question 1

You argue that the desert fathers retreated from the world in a dangerous withdrawal, but how do you reconcile this critique with Jesus' own pattern of withdrawing to wilderness places for prayer and preparation (Mark 1:35, Luke 5:16)? If our Lord Himself prioritized solitude with the Father, on what basis do you label this same practice as inherently dangerous rather than as a necessary rhythm of spiritual formation?

## Question 2

You express concern about desert asceticism being potentially unbiblical, yet Paul explicitly references athletes exercising self-control and disciplining their bodies (1 Corinthians 9:24-27), and the author of Hebrews calls us to lay aside every weight and sin (Hebrews 12:1). How do you distinguish between "dangerous asceticism" and the biblical call to self-denial without rendering the latter meaningless?

## Question 3

You warn about the dangers of subjectivity and mysticism, but the desert fathers' teachings were tested within community and submitted to spiritual directors—hardly the model of unchecked individualism you describe. Given that Jesus taught His disciples to "test the spirits" (1 John 4:1) rather than abandon all mystical experience, why do you assume the desert mothers and fathers were incapable of such discernment?
