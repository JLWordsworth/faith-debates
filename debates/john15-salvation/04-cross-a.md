# Cross-Examination Questions - Calvinist to Arminian

## Question 1: The "In Christ" Language and Apostasy Mechanics

You have argued strongly that "in Me" (en emoi) in John 15:2 must refer to genuine believers because Paul uses "in Christ" language consistently for regenerate believers. But I must press you on the mechanics of your position: If a person can be genuinely united to Christ—born again, indwelt by the Holy Spirit, made a new creation—and then through persistent unbelief sever themselves from that union and perish eternally, what exactly happens spiritually when this "severing" occurs?

Specifically:
- Does the Holy Spirit depart from a regenerate person who ceases to believe?
- If so, how does this square with Paul's teaching that the Holy Spirit is the "seal" and "guarantee" of our inheritance (Ephesians 1:13-14)?
- If a truly regenerate person can be "un-regenerated," does this not effectively make the new birth reversible?
- And if the new birth is reversible, in what meaningful sense can we speak of God's "irrevocable gifts" and calling (Romans 11:29)?

You cite Romans 11:20-22 as proof that branches truly in the tree can be cut off, but Paul concludes that chapter by declaring that "the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable" (Romans 11:29). How do you reconcile a reversible union with Christ with an irreversible divine calling?

## Question 2: The Nature of Faith and the Warnings

In both your opening statement and rebuttals, you emphasize that commands to "abide" imply genuine choice and possibility of failure. You argue that if abiding were automatic, the commands would be meaningless. But this seems to misunderstand the Calvinist position, which has always maintained that believers make real choices—choices that are both free and ensured by God's preserving grace.

My question concerns your understanding of the nature of faith itself. You acknowledge that God "works to preserve those who continue in faith" and that "the warning of John 15 is one of the means God uses to keep His saints from falling." But here is the tension:

If God's preserving work ultimately succeeds only for those who continue in faith, and whether one continues in faith depends ultimately on the human will maintaining that faith, then does not salvation ultimately depend on human rather than divine faithfulness? When Jesus says "If you keep My commandments, you will remain in My love" (John 15:10), you see this as establishing human obedience as the condition for remaining. But what happens when a believer stumbles? What happens when a true disciple, like Peter, denies Christ—perhaps repeatedly? Is Peter cut off at that moment? If not, how much failure is permitted before being cut off? And where in the text does Jesus specify the threshold?

Relatedly, you argue that warnings would be "deceptive" if the danger were not real. But is this not to assume that warnings can only function by describing unconditional possibilities? Could it not be that God's warnings are one of the precise means by which He ensures His elect do persevere—as Hebrews 3:12-14 suggests, where the warning itself is presented as part of God's preserving work ("if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end")?

## Question 3: Judas, John 13:10, and the Warning Audience

You have argued that Jesus' declaration "You are already clean" (John 15:3) proves He was addressing genuine believers, making the warning about being cut off a warning to genuine disciples. You acknowledge that in John 13:10, Jesus said "you are clean, though not every one of you"—explicitly excepting Judas. Your response to this in your second rebuttal was that "the warning does not say 'some of you are truly in Me and will abide; others only appear to be in Me and will be cut off.' It says 'remain in Me' to all twelve, including the eleven who were genuinely clean."

But this seems to prove the opposite of what you intend. If Judas—who Jesus explicitly said was NOT clean—was nevertheless addressed as one who needed to "remain in Him," then does this not demonstrate that Jesus' warning about branches being cut off applies both to genuine believers (the eleven) and to those who are only externally attached (Judas)? And if the warning functions on both levels simultaneously—warning genuine believers to abide and warning false professors of the danger they face—why must we conclude that the branches actually cut off in verse 6 are the genuine believers rather than the Judases among them?

Furthermore, if Jesus could address Judas as someone who needed to "remain" despite never having been truly clean, does this not support the Calvinist reading that "in Me" in John 15:2 refers to both visible and invisible belonging to Christ? And doesn't this directly undermine your argument that "in Me" must mean regenerate believers because it's the same language Paul uses? Jesus clearly uses "you" language in John 15 to include both the truly clean (the eleven) and the not-truly-clean (Judas). Why then must "in Me" be restricted to the regenerate?

In short: Given that Jesus addressed the command to "remain" to both genuinely clean disciples and to Judas who was not clean, why should we understand the branches that are actually cut off as the genuinely clean disciples rather than those who, like Judas, were never truly regenerate to begin with?
