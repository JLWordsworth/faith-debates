# First Rebuttal - Calvinist Position

## The Plain Reading Is Not Always the Correct Reading

My opponent urges us to take the "plain language" of John 15 at face value—that branches "in Me" who are cut off were genuinely united to Christ. Yet Scripture itself warns us that not all who appear to be part of God's people truly belong to God's people. Romans 9:6 declares, "Not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel." The same pattern appears throughout Scripture: Esau was Isaac's son yet sold his birthright; Judas was among the Twelve yet was a devil; the seed on rocky ground sprang up quickly but withered under trial. The "plain reading" that every branch "in the vine" must be regenerate ignores this consistent biblical pattern of distinguishing between visible and invisible belonging. When Jesus warns in Matthew 7:21-23 that many will say "Lord, Lord" on judgment day, He uses language of those who prophesied and cast out demons in His name—yet He never knew them. They appeared to be connected to Christ, but their appearance did not match reality.

## The "In Christ" Language Does Not Settle the Question

My opponent argues that "en emoi" (in Me) must indicate genuine believers because Paul uses "in Christ" consistently for true believers. But this assumes Jesus and Paul always use identical language with identical precision in every context. Even Paul distinguishes between those who appear to be something and what they truly are (Galatians 2:6). More importantly, Jesus Himself uses "you are clean" language in John 13:10 while immediately excepting Judas: "you are clean, though not every one of you." Judas was one of the twelve, one of those Jesus addressed, one who appeared clean—yet he was not. My opponent notes Jesus addressed eleven genuine believers in John 15, which is true—but that does not mean the warning describes a possibility for those eleven. Rather, Jesus uses the visible failure of some (like Judas, and later, those like Demas who would abandon Paul) as warnings to the genuine disciples. The warning functions precisely because visible membership does not guarantee invisible reality.

## Commands Do Not Impossibility Make

My opponent contends that the commands to "remain in Me" imply genuine choice and possibility of failure. But Calvinism has never denied that believers make genuine choices or that apostasy is impossible in the abstract. What we deny is that true believers—those regenerated by the Holy Spirit—will ultimately apostatize. Hebrews 3:12-14 warns believers to "take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God." Yet the same passage assures us, "We have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end." The warning is real; the possibility is real; but God uses the warning to keep His saints from falling. The same Jesus who commands "remain in Me" also promises in John 10:28, "I give them eternal life, and they will never perish—ever." The command does not undermine the promise; the promise guarantees that the elect will heed the command. Philippians 2:12-13 puts this beautifully: "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure." We work; God works. The command is real; the guarantee is real.

## Romans 11:20-22 Supports, Not Undermines, the Calvinist Reading

My opponent cites Romans 11:20-22 as evidence that Gentile believers truly grafted in can be cut off. But this passage actually supports the Calvinist distinction between visible and invisible belonging. Paul warns the Gentile church collectively against arrogance, noting that God "will not spare you either" if they do not continue. Yet who ultimately constitutes the true "olive tree"? Paul has already answered this in Romans 9:6—not all physical descendants belong to the true Israel. The visible church can be pruned; individuals within it can prove themselves never to have been truly part of the remnant. The warning is genuine because visible membership is no guarantee of election. As Paul says in Romans 11:22, "Note then the kindness and severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off." The continuing in kindness is the evidence, not the condition, of being among the elect. Those who do not continue were never truly part of the kindness in the saving sense.

## The Consistency of John's Theology

Most importantly, John 15 cannot be read in isolation from John's entire theology. The same Gospel that warns of branches being cut off also records Jesus' declaration in John 6:39, "And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day." John 6:40 adds, "For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day." John 10:28 promises eternal life with the assurance "they will never perish—ever." The beloved disciple who recorded these words also wrote 1 John 2:19: "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us." The same John who wrote John 15 looked back on apostasy and explained it as evidence that those who left were never truly part of the community of the saved. This is the inspired interpretation of apostasy by the same author who recorded John 15.
