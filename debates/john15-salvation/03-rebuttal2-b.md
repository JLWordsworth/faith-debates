# Second Rebuttal - Arminian Position

## Warnings Without Real Danger Remain Problematic

My opponent attempts to salvage the idea of warnings without real danger by comparing them to a doctor's warning—genuine even if the doctor will intervene to ensure the medicine is taken. But this analogy fails precisely because the doctor cannot guarantee the outcome. The patient may refuse the medicine despite the warning, and the patient may die. The warning is real precisely because the danger is real and the outcome is not guaranteed. By contrast, my opponent's position requires us to believe that God warns His children about something that cannot happen to them—and that He guarantees it cannot happen to them. This is fundamentally different from a doctor who warns and then works to persuade. If God has rendered apostasy impossible for the elect, then warning the elect about apostasy is warning them about an impossibility. My opponent's attempt to distinguish between "warnings about impossibilities" and "warnings that function as means of preservation" fails because it assumes the latter can occur without the former—but this is precisely the point in question. If I cannot fall, a warning about falling is not a genuine warning but a hollow exercise.

## The Viticulture Argument Backfires

My opponent argues that in viticulture, branches failing to produce fruit are removed because they are drawing sap without producing—and that this supports the Calvinist reading that fruitless branches were never alive. But this actually supports the Arminian position. A branch that draws sap from the vine is, by definition, a living branch connected to the source of life. Dead branches do not draw sap; they are already detached. The very fact that the Father must "cut off" (airei) these branches implies they are attached and receiving life from the vine. My opponent's position requires us to believe that dead branches are being cut off—but dead branches are already severed. The text describes branches that are "in Me" (en emoi) and must be removed. The removal is not a revelation of their prior state but a judicial action that changes their state from attached to detached, from alive (drawing life) to withered (no longer receiving life). The horticultural imagery fits the Arminian understanding perfectly: living branches can be cut off and perish.

## The Security Promises Do Not Exclude the Possibility of Departure

My opponent insists that John 10:28-29 contains language so absolute that it cannot be conditioned: "they will never perish—ever. No one will snatch them out of my hand." But absolute language about external protection does not address internal defection. The promise is that no external enemy—"no one" (ouk estin)—can snatch Christ's sheep. This does not address whether a sheep might cease to be a sheep by ceasing to follow. My opponent argues that "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me" means following is evidence of being a sheep, not a condition for remaining a sheep. But this is precisely the Calvinist assumption rather than the exegetical necessity. The text can just as easily be read as describing the characteristic behavior of Christ's sheep—those who hear, follow, and are kept. Those who cease to follow cease to be among His sheep. The promise of security is for those who are following; it does not guarantee that all who start following will continue. The Arminian affirms God's powerful protection of His people; we simply deny that this protection overrides the human capacity to resist and depart.

## 1 John 2:19 Does Not Teach That Apostates Were Never Regenerate

My opponent argues that 1 John 2:19 provides "inspired commentary" proving that those who depart were never truly regenerate. But this reads more into the text than it actually says. John states that those who departed "were not of us" (ouk esan ex hemon)—but this does not specify the sense in which they were "of us." They may have been genuinely united to Christ but failed to continue, thereby ceasing to be "of us" in the present sense. John says "if they had been of us, they would have continued with us"—which is precisely the Arminian point! Continuing is the necessary condition for remaining "of us." My opponent treats this as proof that the departing individuals were never regenerate, but the text itself does not say this. It says their departure revealed they were not currently "of us"—which is exactly what the Arminian position maintains. Those who depart cease to be part of the community of faith. The retroactive judgment ("they were not of us") is John's pastoral assessment of their final state, not necessarily a denial that they ever experienced genuine union with Christ.

## The "Not Every One of You" Argument Undermines the Calvinist Position

My opponent argues that Jesus' statement in John 13:10—"you are clean, though not every one of you"—proves that Judas was not clean, and therefore the warning in John 15 was addressed to both genuine believers (the eleven) and a false professor (Judas). But this actually undermines the Calvinist reading. If the warning in John 15 is primarily about distinguishing true believers from false professors, why does Jesus not make that distinction explicit in the warning itself? Instead, He addresses all twelve as if they were all branches in the vine who needed to abide. The warning does not say "some of you are truly in Me and will abide; others only appear to be in Me and will be cut off." It says "remain in Me" to all twelve, including the eleven who were genuinely clean. The warning assumes that all twelve are branches in the vine who need to continue abiding. Judas was a branch in the vine who failed to abide and was cut off. This is exactly what the Arminian position teaches: genuine union with Christ is maintained by continuing faith; those who cease to abide are cut off. The presence of Judas does not prove that all who are cut off were never genuinely united; it proves that even among those Jesus washes and declares clean, there is the danger of failing to abide and being cut off.

## The Whole Counsel of Scripture Must Include the Warnings

My opponent concludes by appealing to "the whole counsel of God," insisting that the Calvinist interpretation holds all of Scripture together. But the Calvinist interpretation does not actually hold the warning passages together with the assurance passages; it systematically neutralizes the warnings by interpreting them through the lens of the assurance passages. When Jesus warns that branches not abiding will be cut off and burned, the Calvinist says this describes people who were never really branches. When Paul warns that branches not continuing in God's kindness will be cut off (Romans 11:22), the Calvinist says this describes people who were never really grafted in. When the author of Hebrews warns that those who have shared in the Holy Spirit can fall away (Hebrews 6:4-6), the Calvinist says this describes people who never truly partook of the Holy Spirit. This is not holding all of Scripture together; it is allowing one theological commitment to determine the interpretation of all warning passages. The Arminian position takes both the promises and the warnings at face value: God's promises are real, and His warnings are real. He graciously preserves those who continue in faith, but those who fail to continue in faith—despite having been truly united to Him—can be cut off. This is the plain reading of John 15, and it honors both the promises and the warnings as genuine and meaningful.

In closing, the Arminian interpretation of John 15 takes the text at face value: branches "in Christ" are branches that have genuine union with Him; the command to abide is a real command with real force; the warning about being cut off and burned is a real warning to real disciples; and the danger is genuine because the outcome is not guaranteed. The eleven disciples who were truly clean needed this warning, and so do we. Salvation is by grace through faith, and it is maintained by grace through continuing faith. Let us abide in Him.
