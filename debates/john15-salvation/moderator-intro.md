# Debate: Can One Lose Their Salvation According to John 15?

## Introduction

The Gospel of John, chapter 15, contains one of Jesus' most memorable and theologically significant teachings—the allegory of the vine and the branches. Delivered on the night of His betrayal, as Jesus and His disciples depart from the upper room and make their way toward Gethsemane, this discourse forms part of Jesus' final teachings to His followers before His crucifixion.

In this passage, Jesus identifies Himself as the "true vine" and His Father as the "keeper of the vineyard." His disciples are described as branches—those who "remain" in Him will bear much fruit, while branches that do not remain are cut off, wither, and are thrown into the fire to be burned. The imagery is vivid and the warning is severe. The command to "remain" (or "abide") in Christ appears repeatedly throughout the passage, emphasizing the necessity of ongoing connection to the vine for spiritual vitality and fruitfulness.

For centuries, Christians have debated how to interpret this passage. At the heart of the discussion is a question of profound pastoral and theological significance: What does it mean to "remain" in Christ, and what happens to those who do not? Specifically, can a person who is truly united to Christ later sever that connection and be lost?

## The Question

Can one lose their salvation according to John 15?

## Position A: Calvinist Interpretation

The Calvinist interpretation maintains that the warnings about branches being cut off and burned refer to those who only appear to be part of the vine but were never truly regenerate. From this perspective, being "in the vine" refers to a visible, external attachment to Christ and His community—not necessarily to saving, spiritual union. Those who fall away demonstrate by their apostasy that they were never genuine believers to begin with. Key to this view is the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints: those whom God has truly regenerated will certainly persevere in faith to the end, and the warnings in Scripture serve as one of God's appointed means for preserving His elect, not as indications that salvation can be genuinely lost.

## Position B: Arminian Interpretation

The Arminian interpretation teaches that the branches in the vine represent genuine believers who are truly united to Christ. From this perspective, the warning that branches which do not abide will be cut off, withered, and burned is a real warning to real believers about the genuine danger of apostasy. The command to "remain" is an imperative with real force—implying both the responsibility to continue in faith and the genuine possibility of failing to do so. Those who fail to continue in faith and obedience, despite having been truly united to Christ, can be severed from Him and perish eternally. Salvation is maintained by continuing in faith and abiding in Christ.
