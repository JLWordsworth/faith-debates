# Closing Statement - Arminian Position

## The Gravity of the Warning

The question before us ultimately comes down to this: Do we take Jesus' warning at face value, or do we reinterpret it through a theological lens that neutralizes its force? The Arminian position accepts the plain reading of the text: branches "in Me" who do not abide will be cut off, withered, gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. These branches are genuinely united to Christ—they derive their life from the vine—and they can be severed from that life through persistent unbelief and failure to abide. My worthy opponent has raised important questions about the mechanics of apostasy, the nature of faith, and the pastoral implications of our position. I am grateful for these challenges, as they force us to think more carefully about what we believe and why.

## Responding to the Cross-Examination

On the question of the mechanics of apostasy: What happens when a regenerate person ceases to believe? The Arminian position maintains that salvation is a living relationship that must be maintained by continuing faith. When a person persistently rejects the faith they once professed, they sever themselves from the source of life. The Holy Spirit, who is indeed the "seal" and "guarantee" of our inheritance, does not force His presence on those who persistently reject Him. Paul's teaching in Romans 11:20-22 directly addresses this: Gentile branches truly grafted into the olive tree can be cut off "if they do not continue in God's kindness." The warning is real, the condition is clear, and the possibility of being cut off is genuine. As for God's "irrevocable gifts" and calling (Romans 11:29), this refers to His calling of ethnic Israel and His corporate purposes—not to the unconditional preservation of every individual who has ever experienced genuine union with Christ.

On the nature of faith and the warnings: My opponent asks what happens when a believer stumbles, or when a true disciple like Peter denies Christ. The Arminian position has always distinguished between temporary stumbling and persistent, final unbelief. Peter denied Christ, but he repented and returned. Judas betrayed Christ and persisted in unbelief. The warning of John 15 is not about every momentary failure but about a settled refusal to abide. As for the threshold, Jesus does not specify precisely how much failure constitutes apostasy—any more than He specifies precisely how much adultery constitutes sexual immorality. What He makes clear is the principle: those who do not abide will be cut off. The warnings are not deceptive because the danger is real. My opponent's analogy of a parent warning a child about a disconnected stove actually proves my point: if the danger is not real, the warning is deceptive. Jesus' warnings are genuine because the danger is genuine.

On Judas and the audience of the warning: My opponent argues that because Jesus addressed the command to "remain" to both genuine believers and Judas, this proves the warning is about false professors. But this misses the point. The fact that Judas was among those addressed actually demonstrates that "in Me" can include genuine union—and that even those with genuine union (the eleven) are warned about the danger of failing to abide. The warning does not distinguish between "true branches who will abide" and "false branches who will be cut off." It warns all twelve to abide. The fact that one of them (Judas) would not abide does not prove he was never truly in the vine. It proves that being in the vine is not enough—one must continue to abide.

## The Pastoral Reality of the Warnings

My opponent suggests that the Arminian position undermines assurance because salvation ultimately depends on human faithfulness rather than divine faithfulness. But this misunderstands the Arminian position. We affirm that salvation is entirely by grace—both initially and progressively. We are saved by grace through faith, and we are kept by grace through continuing faith. God does His part—He provides the means of grace, He sends His Spirit, He warns us, He empowers us. And we must do our part—we believe, we abide, we continue. Assurance comes not from pretending we cannot fall, but from trusting the One who is able to keep us from falling—and who warns us precisely because He wants us to be kept.

The Calvinist position, by contrast, cannot avoid making warnings functionally deceptive. If it is impossible for true believers to apostatize, then warning true believers about apostasy is warning them about something that cannot happen to them. My opponent attempts to avoid this by saying warnings function as "means of preservation." But a warning that describes an impossibility is not a genuine warning—it is a hollow exercise, a scare tactic that misrepresents reality. When Jesus warns His disciples—whom He has just declared clean—that they will be cut off and burned if they do not abide, He is not engaging in some complex instrumental strategy where the warning describes a prevented impossibility. He is warning them about a real danger, and the warning is real because the danger is real.

## The Coherence of the Arminian Reading

The Arminian interpretation of John 15 takes the text at face value: branches "in Me" are genuinely united to Christ; the command to abide is a real command with real force; the warning about being cut off and burned is a real warning to real disciples; and the danger is genuine because the outcome is not guaranteed. This reading honors the consistent New Testament usage of "in Christ" language for genuine believers. It honors the hortatory nature of the commands—imperatives imply real choices, not automatic outcomes. It honors the severity of the warnings—warnings that would be deceptive if the danger were not real. And it honors the whole counsel of Scripture, which contains both glorious promises and sober warnings, both assurances of God's preserving grace and exhortations to continue in the faith.

Salvation is by grace through faith, and it is maintained by grace through continuing faith. The eleven disciples who were truly clean needed this warning, and so do we. The danger is real, the warning is real, and the grace that enables us to abide is real. Let us abide in Him—not because we cannot fall, but because He who is able to keep us from falling warns us to abide, and His warnings are among the means by which He keeps us.

The branches in John 15 that are cut off and burned were truly united to Christ—they were "in Him." Jesus addresses His disciples whom He has just declared clean, warning them to remain in Him because it is possible to be cut off. The imperatives to abide would be meaningless if continuance were automatic. While God graciously preserves those who continue in faith, the warnings throughout Scripture—including the severe warning of John 15—are real and meaningful. Genuine believers can, through persistent unbelief and failure to abide, sever themselves from the Vine and perish. As Paul warns in Romans 11:20-22, branches truly in the olive tree can be cut off if they do not continue in God's kindness. Salvation is by grace through faith, and it is maintained by grace through continuing faith. Let us abide in Him.
