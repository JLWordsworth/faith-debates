# Opening Statement - Arminian Position

## The Question of John 15: Can Genuine Believers Be Cut Off?

The question before us demands careful attention to the plain language of Jesus' teaching in John 15. Can a person truly united to Christ later be severed from Him and lost? The Arminian position, reading John 15 in its most straightforward sense, answers yes. The branches that are cut off, withered, and burned were genuinely "in" Christ—they were part of the vine, recipients of its life, yet through failure to abide were severed and perished. This interpretation takes Jesus' warning at face value as a genuine threat to genuine disciples, not as a hypothetical warning about those who were never truly saved to begin with. When Jesus speaks of branches "in Me" that bear no fruit and are cut off (John 15:2), He uses the same language Paul uses throughout his epistles to describe genuine believers. These are not mere external attachers to the vine but branches truly part of it.

## "In Me" Means Genuine Union

The critical phrase in John 15:2 is "en emoi"—"in Me." This is not the language of external attachment but of genuine, vital union. Throughout the New Testament, "in Christ" consistently refers to true believers. Paul writes that there is "no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" (Romans 8:1), that "if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation" (2 Corinthians 5:17), and that God chose us "in Him before the foundation of the world" (Ephesians 1:4). Why would Jesus use this exact language in John 15 to describe people who were never truly regenerated? The straightforward reading is that these branches represent genuine believers who fail to abide and are therefore cut off. Importantly, Jesus addresses disciples He has just declared clean: "You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you" (John 15:3). The same language Jesus used earlier when washing the disciples' feet, saying "you are clean, though not every one of you" (John 13:10)—the exception being Judas. To these eleven genuine believers, Jesus gives the solemn warning about abiding. The warning is addressed to regenerate disciples, not mere professors.

## The Commands Are Real—So Are the Conditions

Jesus commands His disciples to "remain in Me" (John 15:4) and "remain in My love" (John 15:9). These are imperatives—commands with real force. Commands imply genuine choice and the possibility of failure. Jesus would not command His disciples to do something that was automatically guaranteed or impossible to violate. The repeated emphasis on abiding (meno) occurs eleven times in this passage alone, highlighting its crucial importance. Jesus explicitly conditions abiding on obedience: "If you keep My commandments, you will remain in My love" (John 15:10). The converse implication is clear: if you do not keep His commandments, you will NOT remain in His love. The promises are explicitly conditional: "The one who remains in Me, and I in him, will bear much fruit" (John 15:5); "If you remain in Me and My words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you" (John 15:7). These conditions would be meaningless if abiding were automatically guaranteed for all true believers.

## The Warning Is Too Severe for Hypotheticals

Jesus warns that branches which do not abide are "thrown away," "wither," and are "gathered up, thrown into the fire, and burned" (John 15:6). This is the language of final judgment—eternal destruction. If these branches merely represented false professors who were never truly saved, the warning would be deceptive—a warning about an impossibility presented as though it were real. But Jesus does not deal in deceptive warnings. His warnings are genuine because the danger is genuine. This parallels Paul's warning in Romans 11:20-22 to Gentile believers grafted into the olive tree: "Do not be arrogant, but fear. For if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you either... He is kind to you, provided that you continue in His kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off." Here, branches truly in the tree are warned they can be cut off if they do not continue in faith. The vine and branches analogy perfectly illustrates this reality: the branch receives its life from the vine (salvation is by grace through faith), the branch must remain connected to live (salvation must be maintained by faith), and a branch can be cut off and wither (genuine believers can apostatize). Salvation is by grace through faith, and it is maintained by grace through continuing faith.
