# First Rebuttal - Arminian Position

## The Visible/Invisible Distinction Is Imported Into the Text

My opponent argues we must distinguish between visible and invisible belonging to Christ, citing Romans 9:6 and Judas as examples. But this is precisely the question: Does John 15 teach this distinction, or does it teach that genuine branches can be cut off? My opponent imports a theological distinction into the text rather than allowing the text to speak on its own terms. Jesus does not say "branches appearing to be in Me" or "branches that seem to be attached." He says branches *in* Him (en emoi)—the same language used throughout the New Testament for genuine believers. If Jesus wanted to describe false professors, He could have spoken of branches "near the vine" or "attached only externally." Instead, He describes branches that derive their life from the vine but are cut off due to unfruitfulness. The visible/invisible distinction, while perhaps true elsewhere, cannot be assumed to be the meaning of John 15:1-6 without circular reasoning.

## The Meaning of "In Me" Cannot Be Evaded

My opponent suggests Jesus and Paul may use "in Christ" language differently, or that Jesus uses it less precisely. But this is an extraordinary claim requiring extraordinary evidence. "In Christ" is the most consistent Pauline description of genuine believers—used approximately eighty times in Paul's letters. If Jesus meant something different by "in Me," why would He choose language that His Spirit would later inspire Paul to use exclusively for regenerate believers? More to the point, John himself uses "in Me" language elsewhere for genuine believers: "If anyone does not abide in Me he is thrown away like a branch and withers" (John 15:6). In John 17:21, Jesus prays that believers "may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us." The consistent usage points to genuine union. My opponent's argument requires us to believe that "in Me" in John 15:2 is the one place in the entire New Testament where "in Christ" means something other than genuine union—a highly unlikely reading.

## 1 John 2:19 Does Not Solve the Problem

My opponent cites 1 John 2:19 as the inspired interpretation of apostasy: "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us." This is an important passage, but it does not settle the question of John 15. First, 1 John 2:19 is written decades after John's Gospel, looking back on specific individuals who left the Johannine community. John is making a retroactive judgment about their true spiritual state based on their persistent departure. Second, the passage says "if they had been of us, they would have continued"—which is precisely the Arminian point! Continuing is the evidence of being truly "of us." But this does not prove that those who depart were never genuinely united. Rather, it proves that those who are genuinely regenerate will, by God's grace, persevere. The Arminian position has always acknowledged that God works to preserve those who continue in faith. What we deny is that this perseverance is automatic or unconditional. The warning of John 15 is one of the means God uses to keep His saints from falling—and the warning only works if the danger is real.

## The Warnings Cannot Be Mere Instruments Without Real Danger

My opponent argues that warnings function to keep believers from falling, even though falling is impossible for the elect. But this creates a serious theological problem: If it is impossible for true believers to apostatize, then warnings about apostasy are warnings about an impossibility. This makes the warnings functionally deceptive. Imagine a parent telling a child, "If you don't eat your vegetables, you will turn into a pumpkin," when the parent knows perfectly well the child cannot turn into a pumpkin. The warning might produce obedience, but it would be a deceptive warning. Yet my opponent suggests Jesus warns about something that cannot happen to true believers. The more natural reading is that the danger is real, the warning is genuine, and God uses the warning to keep believers from falling into that real danger. This preserves both the truthfulness of the warning and the effectiveness of God's preserving work.

## John 6:39 and John 10:28 Must Be Reconciled, Not Prioritized

My opponent emphasizes Jesus' promises in John 6:39 that He will "lose nothing" and John 10:28 that believers "will never perish—ever." These are glorious promises that Arminians affirm. But the Calvinist reading assumes these promises describe unconditional preservation. Yet even these promises contain implicit conditions. In John 6:40, eternal life is promised to "everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him"—present continuous belief. In John 10:27-28, Jesus says, "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand." The promise of security is given to those who hear and follow. No external enemy can snatch Christ's sheep—but this does not address the possibility that a sheep might cease to follow. The promises and the warnings must both be taken seriously, not pitted against each other.

## The Vine Analogy Points to Vital Relationship, Not Mechanical Attachment

The vine and branches imagery is chosen precisely because it illustrates a living, vital relationship that can be severed. A branch receives its life from the vine; a branch can be cut off and wither. This is not the imagery of mechanical attachment that cannot be broken. It is the imagery of living, organic union that requires continual connection for life. My opponent's reading requires us to see the branches that are cut off as "dead branches that were never alive." But dead branches do not need to be cut off—they are already dead. It is living branches that fail to bear fruit that are removed. The imagery fits the Arminian understanding perfectly: genuinely united branches that must continue to abide or be cut off. The commands to abide would be meaningless if abiding were automatic. The warnings would be deceptive if the danger were not real. The most natural reading of the text is that Jesus warns His genuine disciples about a genuine danger—the danger of failing to abide in Him and thereby being cut off from the source of life.
