# Cross-Examination Questions - Arminian to Calvinist

## Question 1: The "In Me" Language and the Problem of Redefinition

You have argued that "in Me" (en emoi) in John 15:2 refers to those who are only externally attached to Christ and His church, not to genuinely regenerate believers. This allows you to maintain that those cut off were never truly saved. But I must press you on a significant problem with this interpretation: It requires redefining Paul's consistent usage of "in Christ" language when applied to this passage.

When Paul uses "in Christ," "in Him," or similar language, he unfailingly refers to genuine believers who possess all spiritual blessings:

- **Romans 8:1** - "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus"
- **2 Corinthians 5:17** - "If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation"
- **Ephesians 1:3** - "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing"
- **Ephesians 1:4** - "He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world"
- **Ephesians 1:7** - "In Him we have redemption through His blood"
- **Ephesians 2:6** - "God raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus"

None of these passages allow for "in Christ" to mean merely external attachment. Each describes the reality of those who are truly regenerate. Yet you would have us understand that when Jesus speaks of branches "in Me" (using the very same prepositional phrase en emoi), He suddenly means something entirely different—mere external profession rather than saving union.

My question is this: On what exegetical basis do you justify importing a different meaning for "in Me" in John 15:2 than the meaning "in Christ" carries everywhere else in the New Testament? If Paul's "in Christ" consistently refers to saving union, and Jesus uses the same prepositional language, should we not assume He means the same thing unless the context absolutely forces us to do otherwise? And does not your interpretation effectively require that Jesus is using "in Me" in a way that would mislead any reader familiar with Pauline usage—especially when His audience hearing John 15 would have no category for this distinction between visible and invisible union?

## Question 2: The Audience Already Clean and the Reality of the Warning

You have responded to my argument that Jesus' declaration "You are already clean" (John 15:3) proves He was addressing genuine believers. You acknowledge that Judas—whom Jesus explicitly said was NOT clean in John 13:10—was among those addressed. You then argue that this actually supports your position: it shows Jesus was addressing both genuine believers and false professors, so the warning about being cut off can apply to those like Judas who were never truly regenerate.

But this response misses a crucial point in the text. Let me press you on the specific sequence:

In John 13:10-11, Jesus tells the disciples, "you are clean, though not every one of you." The text immediately explains: "For He knew who would betray Him; that was why He said not every one was clean." Judas is explicitly identified as the one NOT clean.

Now in John 15:3, Jesus tells these same disciples: "You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you." And then in 15:4-6, He gives the warning about abiding or being cut off.

The question I have for you is this: If Jesus was using the vine metaphor primarily to warn false professors like Judas, why would He explicitly reassure the disciples—including Judas—that they are "already clean" immediately before giving the warning? Does not this reassurance make the warning more, not less, serious for those who are truly clean? If someone is declared clean and then warned they can be cut off, burned, and destroyed if they do not abide, does this not indicate that genuine cleanness does not guarantee final salvation apart from continuing to abide?

Furthermore, if your view is correct—that the warning is primarily for Judas-types who were never truly regenerate—why does Jesus not simply say, "Some of you are truly in Me and will abide; others only appear to be in Me and will be cut off"? Why instead does He issue the warning uniformly to all twelve: "Remain in Me"?

Relatedly, you argue that Jesus includes Judas to show "in Me" can mean external attachment. But if that's the case, then when Jesus tells them "You are already clean," and Judas is included in that "you," does "you are clean" also include Judas? Or is Judas somehow excluded from the "you" of verse 3 but included in the "you" of verse 4? How exactly does the exegesis work here?

## Question 3: The Function of Warnings and the Problem of "Deceptive" Threats

You have argued that the severe warnings in John 15:6—about branches being gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned—function as one of God's appointed means for preserving His elect. You cite Hebrews 3:12-14 to show that warnings can be means of grace rather than descriptions of actual possibilities.

But I want to press you on the pastoral and theological implications of this view. If, as you maintain, the branches that are cut off were never truly regenerate, then the warning in John 15:6 is not describing an actual possibility for genuine believers. It is describing what will happen to those who are merely professing faith. But Jesus gives this warning to His disciples—whom He has just declared clean—without qualifying it by saying, "Of course, this doesn't apply to you truly clean ones."

Consider how this would have been heard by the eleven genuine disciples. They have just been told they are clean (v. 3), commanded to abide (v. 4), and warned with the most severe language imaginable about the consequences of not abiding (v. 6). According to your view, this warning is not actually describing a danger they face—it is describing a danger that only those who are falsely professing face.

My question is: Does this not make Jesus' warning deceptive, or at least deeply misleading, to His genuine disciples? If I warn my child, "If you touch the stove, you will be burned," when in fact the stove has been disconnected and cannot burn anyone, I have not spoken truthfully. I have given a warning about a danger that does not actually exist.

You may say the warning still functions to keep them from touching the stove. But the fundamental problem remains: The warning misrepresents reality. It describes a consequence that will not actually occur for the person being warned.

Similarly, if Jesus warns His disciples—whom He has just declared clean—that they will be cut off, withered, gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned if they do not abide, when in fact none of them will ever experience this fate because God will preserve them, has He not warned them about something that cannot actually happen to them?

You may respond that warnings function instrumentally rather than descriptively—that God uses them to bring about the very outcome they warn against. But this seems to turn warnings into something other than genuine warnings. A genuine warning describes a real danger that can actually be incurred. An instrumental warning describes a supposed danger that will be prevented precisely by the giving of the warning—which means the warning is not describing a real possibility but a prevented impossibility.

So my question is: How do you avoid the conclusion that, on your view, Jesus' warnings are not genuine warnings but instruments of preservation that misrepresent the actual dangers faced by those being warned? And does this not require us to understand Jesus' warning language in a way that is fundamentally different from how warnings work in ordinary human communication?
