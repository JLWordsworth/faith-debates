# First Rebuttal - Atheism

My opponent has defended the resurrection evidence with historical arguments worth examining carefully. They suggest that the 1 Corinthians 15 creed dates to 3-5 years after the crucifixion and that Paul's reference to "most of whom are still alive" invites verification. But this misreads the historical situation. Paul is writing to a Corinthian church he founded—he's not inviting a general audience to track down 500 unnamed witnesses in Judea. He's reminding his own converts of what they already believe. The claim functions as preaching, not as verifiable testimony accessible to readers. Moreover, the creed's dating is disputed. Even if we accept early dating, this only tells us when Christians *began* proclaiming the resurrection, not whether the proclamation is true. Early proclamation of a belief doesn't establish the belief's truth—early Muslims proclaimed Muhammad's night journey to Jerusalem, early Mormons proclaimed golden plates, and so on. The intensity and timing of belief cannot substitute for independent verification.

My opponent argues that the empty tomb is universally acknowledged because opponents accused disciples of stealing the body. But this assumes the Gospel accounts accurately reflect what Jewish opponents said. Matthew is the only Gospel that mentions the stolen-body explanation, written decades after the events by an author with a clear theological agenda. We have no independent Jewish or Roman sources confirming either the empty tomb or the stolen-body accusation. The story that guards were posted at the tomb appears only in Matthew and contains elements that seem apologetically motivated—guards were said to be bribed to say they fell asleep, which is precisely what a Christian author might invent to explain away a competing explanation. We cannot use the Gospels to verify what non-Christians said when the Gospels themselves are the source for those claims. My opponent also notes that Christianity exploded in Jerusalem where the events happened. But we have minimal first-century historical documentation of this "explosion." Most of what we know about early Christianity comes from Christian sources written decades later. The growth of a religious movement is not unique to Christianity—Islam spread even faster, and we don't conclude its miracle claims are true on that basis.

Regarding divine hiddenness, my opponent suggests God might desire relationship based on faith rather than coercive certainty. But this frames the choice as between coercion and uncertainty, ignoring a third option: sufficient evidence for reasonable trust without coercive force. God could provide evidence clear enough that sincere seekers recognize Him, while still allowing room for voluntary response. The fact that millions of sincere seekers report finding God is恰恰 what we'd expect if religious experience is a psychological phenomenon accessible to those who adopt faith. Former atheists like C.S. Lewis converted to Christianity, but former Christians like Bart Ehrman and Dan Barker deconverted to atheism. The traffic runs both ways, which suggests that conversion experiences reflect psychological and cultural factors rather than encounters with objective reality. My opponent asks "why would anyone find God if he doesn't exist?"—but this is like asking why anyone would report seeing alien abductions if aliens aren't visiting. The answer is that human minds produce vivid, persuasive experiences that feel real but may not correspond to external reality.

My opponent argues that the problem of evil doesn't disprove God's existence because we can't know divine purposes, and that Christianity's solution is God entering into suffering through the cross. But this response shifts from defense to explanation in a problematic way. The point of the evidential problem of evil is not that suffering is logically incompatible with God, but that the amount, intensity, and apparent pointlessness of suffering is more probable in a godless universe than in one governed by an omnipotent, omnibenevolent deity. My opponent appeals to mystery—we can't see God's purposes in suffering. But this makes the theistic position unfalsifiable. Any amount or kind of suffering can be explained by "mysterious divine purposes," which means the theory can't be tested or disconfirmed. An omnipotent God could achieve any good purpose without horrific suffering, yet we see horrific suffering everywhere. The fact that Jesus suffered doesn't explain why an all-good God would create a world with horrific suffering in the first place. It merely means God chose to participate in the suffering system He created—rather than creating a world without horrific suffering. This seems less than maximally benevolent.

On moral grounding, my opponent claims atheism cannot provide objective moral values. But this misunderstands secular ethical theories. Moral realism—the view that objective moral facts exist—does not require God. Moral facts might be platonic truths that exist necessarily, or they might be grounded in the well-being of conscious creatures. The fact that humans flourish under certain conditions and suffer under others is an objective fact about the universe, independent of anyone's opinion. We don't need God to tell us that causing gratuitous suffering is wrong; we can recognize this through reason, empathy, and understanding of consequences. Moreover, the divine command theory my opponent implicitly endorses faces the Euthyphro dilemma: is something good because God commands it, or does God command it because it's good? If the former, morality is arbitrary—if God commanded torture, it would be good. If the latter, goodness exists independently of God, and we don't need God to ground morality. Theism doesn't solve the moral grounding problem; it just relocates it.

My opponent suggests that features like the universe's origin, fine-tuning, and consciousness are better explained by theism than naturalism. But this assumes naturalism can't explain these phenomena, which is historically premature. The origin of the universe from nothing is being actively investigated by cosmologists through quantum gravity theories. Fine-tuning has naturalistic explanations including the multiverse and observational selection effects. Consciousness research is rapidly advancing through neuroscience. The history of science shows that "features better explained by theism" consistently become explained by naturalism once we understand them better. My opponent mentions that "explaining nature by nature is like explaining a window by pointing to the window." But this misunderstands the scientific enterprise. Science doesn't explain everything by nature—it explains natural phenomena through natural causes. The origin of nature itself may be a different kind of question, but the answer "God did it" has no predictive power, no testability, and no track record of success. It's a science-stopper, not a genuine explanation. The question remains: what specific evidence makes theism more probable than naturalism? So far, I haven't seen evidence that couldn't be equally or better explained by naturalistic means.
