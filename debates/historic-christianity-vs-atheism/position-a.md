# Position A: Historic Christianity

## Position Name
**Historic Christianity** - The orthodox, foundational Christian faith rooted in the historical death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, adhering to essential doctrines passed down through the centuries, including the authority of Scripture, the Trinity, substitutionary atonement, and the divinity of Christ. It is characterized as a faith anchored in objective, historical truth.

## Overview

Historic Christianity represents the core beliefs that have defined orthodox Christian faith across two millennia, transcending denominational boundaries while centering on the person and work of Jesus Christ. Unlike later theological developments or sects, Historic Christianity affirms that God has acted decisively in human history—most notably in the incarnation, death, and bodily resurrection of Jesus—and that these events are verifiable historical realities, not merely spiritual metaphors. This position holds that Christianity is uniquely grounded in real space-time events, making claims that can be investigated historically and evidentially.

## Core Beliefs

- **The Authority of Scripture**: The Bible (Old and New Testaments) is the inspired, infallible Word of God, serving as the ultimate authority for faith and practice. It is not merely human wisdom but divine revelation, accurately conveying God's truth and redemptive plan.

- **The Trinity**: God exists eternally as one Being in three Persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Each Person is fully God, sharing the same divine essence, yet the Persons are distinct. This mystery is foundational to understanding God's nature and His work in salvation.

- **The Incarnation and Deity of Christ**: Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man, the eternal Word who became flesh. He existed from eternity with the Father, took on human nature through the virgin birth, and remains both truly divine and truly human in one Person forever.

- **Substitutionary Atonement**: Christ's death on the cross was a sacrificial, substitutionary act in which He bore the penalty for human sin. His death satisfies God's justice, making forgiveness possible and reconciling sinful humanity to a holy God.

- **The Bodily Resurrection**: Jesus Christ rose bodily from the dead on the third day, conquering death and demonstrating His divine identity. This historical event validates His claims, confirms the truth of His teachings, and provides the basis for the future resurrection of believers.

- **Salvation by Grace Through Faith**: Salvation is a gift of God's grace, received through faith in Christ alone, not through human works or merit. This salvation transforms believers, empowers righteous living, and assures eternal life.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Historical Argument for the Resurrection

The resurrection of Jesus is the cornerstone of Historic Christianity and is supported by compelling historical evidence. Unlike myths that develop slowly over centuries, the resurrection proclamation emerged immediately in Jerusalem, where Jesus had been publicly executed. Key evidences include: (1) the empty tomb—acknowledged even by Jewish leaders who claimed the disciples stole the body; (2) post-resurrection appearances to over 500 people at once, many of whom were still alive when Paul wrote and could be interviewed; (3) the transformation of the disciples from fearful fugitives into bold martyrs willing to die for their testimony—people do not die for what they know to be a lie; (4) the conversion of skeptics like James (Jesus' brother) and Saul of Tarsus (Paul), who were initially hostile but became convinced by encounters with the risen Christ; and (5) the rapid spread of Christianity in the very city where Jesus was crucified, which would have been impossible without an empty tomb. The resurrection explains these facts better than any alternative theory.

### 2. The Fulfilled Prophecy Argument

The Bible contains hundreds of prophecies written centuries before their fulfillment, demonstrating supernatural knowledge that points to divine authorship. The Messianic prophecies are particularly compelling: Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22 vividly describe crucifixion centuries before that method of execution was invented. Micah 5:2 predicts Bethlehem as the Messiah's birthplace. Daniel 9:24-26 prophesies the exact timing of the Messiah's appearance (the "seventy weeks")—calculating to the time of Jesus' ministry. Isaiah 7:14 predicts a virgin birth. Isaiah 61:1-2 describes the Messiah's ministry of preaching good news, healing, and liberation—exactly Jesus' stated mission (Luke 4:18-21). The statistical probability of one person fulfilling even a handful of these specific prophecies is astronomically low, yet Jesus fulfilled dozens. This pattern cannot be reasonably explained as coincidence or deliberate fulfillment (Jesus could not control His birthplace, the manner of His death, or many other details).

### 3. The Argument from Cosmology and Fine-Tuning

While atheism must account for the origin of the universe from nothing, Historic Christianity affirms that "in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth" (Genesis 1:1). Modern cosmology confirms that the universe had a beginning (the Big Bang), pointing to a transcendent cause beyond space, time, and matter. Even more compelling is the fine-tuning of the universe for life: the gravitational constant, expansion rate of the universe, electromagnetic force, and dozens of other physical parameters are exquisitely calibrated. If any were slightly different, life could not exist. This fine-tuning points to a purposeful Designer. Additionally, the origin of life from non-life remains scientifically inexplicable—no naturalistic theory adequately accounts for the information content in DNA or the complexity of even the simplest living cell. Christianity provides a coherent framework: an intelligent, powerful Creator deliberately designed the universe and life within it.

### 4. The Argument from Objective Morality and Human Dignity

Christianity provides a robust foundation for objective moral values and human dignity. If the universe is merely the product of impersonal forces, as atheism maintains, then morality is ultimately a human construct—a product of evolution, culture, or preference—with no objective binding force. Yet humans universally experience moral obligations as real and binding. We know that torturing children for fun is objectively wrong, not just culturally disfavored. Christianity explains this: we are created in God's image (imago Dei), endowed with intrinsic worth and a moral conscience that reflects God's character. Moral values are grounded in God's nature, which is the standard of goodness. Without God, there is no ultimate basis for human rights, dignity, or justice—concepts that atheists themselves rely on but cannot adequately ground in a materialistic worldview. The very existence of objective morality points to a moral Lawgiver.

### 5. The Argument from Changed Lives and Christian Experience

Christianity claims to transform lives through the power of the Holy Spirit, and history provides abundant evidence. Former persecutors like Paul became martyrs for the faith. Slave traders like John Newton became abolitionists and hymn writers ("Amazing Grace"). Alcoholics, addicts, and broken people find genuine, lasting transformation through faith in Christ. The global spread of Christianity across diverse cultures—producing hospitals, universities, and movements for justice and compassion—cannot be explained merely by human power or persuasion. While subjective experience is not the primary basis for faith, it provides corroborating evidence: millions of believers across two millennia report knowing God personally, experiencing answered prayer, and witnessing supernatural transformation. This widespread, enduring testimony across cultures and centuries is consistent with Christianity's claim to be the truth about God and humanity.

## Key Scriptures

### The Resurrection

- **1 Corinthians 15:3-8** - "For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born."

### The Deity of Christ

- **John 1:1, 14** - "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth."

- **Colossians 2:9** - "For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form."

## Debate Style Guidance

When debating as a Historic Christian, maintain the following approach:

1. **Ground Everything in History**: Emphasize that Christianity makes claims about real historical events that can be investigated. Unlike many religions that are primarily philosophical or mystical, Christianity stands or falls on whether certain events actually happened. Frame the discussion around evidence, not mere subjective experience.

2. **Acknowledge Challenges and Sincerity**: Recognize that honest people struggle with faith, and that difficult questions exist (the problem of evil, biblical contradictions, religious pluralism). Avoid dismissive or arrogant attitudes. Respectful dialogue builds credibility.

3. **Distinguish Essential from Secondary**: Focus on core historic doctrines (the resurrection, the deity of Christ, salvation through Christ) rather than secondary issues where Christians disagree (end times, baptism, church government). Historic Christianity centers on the "mere Christianity" that has been held across traditions.

4. **Use Cumulative Case Reasoning**: No single argument proves Christianity, but together the evidence forms a powerful cumulative case. Historical evidence, fulfilled prophecy, cosmology, morality, changed lives, and philosophical coherence all point in the same direction. Avoid claiming any single argument is "conclusive proof"—rather, show how multiple lines of evidence converge.

5. **Address Atheism's Burden**: Remind listeners that atheism is not a neutral default but a positive claim that bears its own burden of proof. Atheism must account for the origin of the universe, fine-tuning, the origin of life, consciousness, objective morality, meaning, and human rights—without reference to God. Highlight the weaknesses of naturalistic explanations.

6. **Be Clear About What Christianity Claims**: Avoid caricatures of Christianity. Clarify that Historic Christianity does not claim blind faith, nor does it claim God can be proved with mathematical certainty. Rather, it claims that the evidence makes faith reasonable and justified.

7. **Show the Coherence of the Christian Worldview**: Demonstrate how Christianity provides a comprehensive framework that makes sense of reality—the way the world is. It explains why the universe is orderly, why humans have moral consciousness, why we long for meaning and justice, why the world is both beautiful and broken, and how it can be redeemed.

8. **Address the Problem of Evil Directly**: This is atheism's strongest argument. Acknowledge its force, but show that Christianity provides resources to engage it: (a) evil is not part of God's original design but entered through rebellion; (b) God allows evil temporarily for greater goods (free will, soul-making, defeating evil definitively); (c) God entered into suffering personally in Christ; (d) the resurrection guarantees ultimate victory over evil. Atheism, by contrast, cannot call evil truly "evil" without objective moral values—which it cannot ground.

9. **Avoid Proof-Texting**: While using Scripture appropriately, recognize that its authority is not granted by the atheist opponent. Quote Scripture to show what Christianity claims, but support those claims with evidence that an atheist can engage (historical facts, philosophical arguments, scientific considerations).

10. **Maintain Gracious Confidence**: Speak with confidence in the truth of Christianity, but with humility that recognizes you could be wrong. The goal is to win people, not arguments. Let your tone reflect the character of Christ—truth spoken in love. End with an invitation to further exploration rather than condemnation.
