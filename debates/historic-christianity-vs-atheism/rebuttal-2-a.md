# Second Rebuttal - Historic Christianity

My opponent suggests Paul's "most of whom are still alive" was merely preaching to Corinthians who couldn't verify Judean witnesses. But this misunderstands the ancient world's connectivity. Corinth was a major port city; travel and communication between Judea and the Roman world were robust. Paul spent three weeks in Athens debating with philosophers—people traveled, information circulated. More importantly, Paul is making this claim in a document that will circulate widely among churches throughout the Mediterranean. If the 500 witnesses didn't exist, this would be easily exposed. The claim is either true or spectacularly reckless falsification. My opponent compares this to Islam's early claims, but this misses the crucial difference: Muhammad's night journey to Jerusalem was non-verifiable by definition—a private experience between Muhammad and God. Jesus' resurrection was a public event in Jerusalem, accessible to anyone who cared to investigate. The disciples weren't asking people to believe based on private revelation; they were pointing to an empty tomb and living witnesses.

Regarding the empty tomb, my opponent argues we only have Matthew's account of the stolen-body accusation, making it apologetic invention. But this commits the fallacy of arguing from silence. The absence of Jewish sources mentioning the empty tomb doesn't mean they didn't acknowledge it—Jewish sources from this period are extremely sparse, and what survives focuses on their own concerns. What we do know is that early Christians proclaimed the resurrection in Jerusalem, and Judaism didn't produce a counter-narrative saying "here's Jesus' body." The stolen-body explanation itself, even if recorded only by Matthew, shows that even opponents acknowledged the tomb was empty—otherwise they'd simply say "the tomb wasn't empty, look for yourselves." The fact that the competing explanation was "disciples stole it" rather than "Jesus is still in the tomb" is telling. My opponent claims we can't use Gospels to verify what non-Christians said—but by that logic, we can't use any source to verify what opponents said, since all sources are written from some perspective. Historians work with what we have, and the earliest sources we have all affirm the empty tomb.

On divine hiddenness, my opponent argues that people finding God and not finding God cuts both ways, suggesting conversion is merely psychological. But this doesn't address why conversion happens across such diverse cultural and psychological starting points. Why would God-experiences be reported by medieval mystics, modern scientists, tribal villagers, and former skeptics if it's merely cultural conditioning? More importantly, the existence of counterfeit experiences doesn't disprove genuine ones. The fact that people report seeing UFOs doesn't prove there are no actual aircraft in the sky. My opponent is asking for evidence that compels belief regardless of one's disposition—but this assumes God owes us such evidence. Perhaps God provides sufficient evidence for those willing to follow it, while allowing the resistant plausible deniability.

Regarding the problem of evil, my opponent claims my appeal to divine purposes makes theism unfalsifiable. But all comprehensive worldviews have some element of mystery—naturalism cannot explain why there is something rather than nothing, why the universe is intelligible, or how consciousness emerges from matter. The question isn't which worldview has no mysteries, but which has fewer and less problematic ones. Christianity acknowledges mystery while providing a framework where evil is real (not an illusion), will be defeated (not ultimately triumphant), and has been entered into by God Himself (not distant from suffering). Naturalism cannot call evil objectively "evil" or provide ultimate hope that it will be overcome. The cross isn't just God "participating in suffering"—it's God defeating evil through suffering, the weakest thing in the universe. As theologian Jürgen Moltmann said, "God is not only the comforter of the suffering but also the fellow sufferer within creation."

On moral grounding, my opponent appeals to moral realism and platonic truths or creature well-being. But platonic moral truths existing necessarily without any mind to ground them is metaphysically mysterious and causally inert—how do abstract truths exert moral obligation? And "well-being of conscious creatures" merely describes what promotes flourishing—it doesn't tell us why we ought to care about flourishing or why conscious creatures have intrinsic worth. Christianity grounds human worth in being created in God's image and moral obligation in God's nature as the good. The Euthyphro dilemma is false: God commands what is good because His nature IS the good—goodness isn't independent of God or arbitrary, but identical to His character. This provides a robust foundation for objective morality that naturalism struggles to match.

Finally, my opponent suggests that future scientific discoveries may explain what we now attribute to God. But this is a materialist article of faith, not an evidence-based conclusion. Science explains natural phenomena through natural causes, but it cannot explain why nature exists at all, why it's fine-tuned, or why it produces conscious beings who can understand it. These are meta-questions about why the natural world exists with the features it has—not questions about how natural processes work within it. Theism provides a coherent answer: a purposeful Creator designed the universe to be known and inhabited by conscious, moral creatures. Naturalism must treat these features as brute facts with no explanation. The question remains: which worldview makes better sense of the totality of our experience—including the historical evidence for Jesus' resurrection, the fine-tuned universe, objective morality, human consciousness, and the widespread phenomenon of religious experience? I submit that Historic Christianity provides the most comprehensive and satisfying explanation.
