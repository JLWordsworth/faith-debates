# Second Rebuttal - Atheism

My opponent's defense of the resurrection evidence continues to rely on assumptions that don't withstand historical scrutiny. They suggest that Paul's claim about 500 witnesses would be "easily exposed" if false, given travel and communication in the ancient world. But this assumes the 500 were named, identifiable individuals known beyond the Christian community. They weren't. Paul provides no names, no locations, no way to verify. The claim functions as community reinforcement, not as falsifiable testimony. My opponent argues that Jesus' resurrection was a "public event in Jerusalem" unlike Muhammad's private revelation. But what we actually have are not public records of a public event, but theological texts written decades later by believers. The "public event" is reconstructed from these texts, not independently attested. The historical method requires sources that are independent, contemporary, and disinterested. The resurrection accounts are none of these—they're late, theological, and from within the community that believed. The burden of proof for an extraordinary claim lies with the claimant, and "it would be easily exposed if false" is an argument from silence that assumes facts not in evidence.

Regarding the empty tomb and stolen-body accusation, my opponent says my argument commits the "fallacy of arguing from silence" about Jewish sources. But the issue isn't silence—it's that we have no way to confirm that Jewish opponents actually acknowledged an empty tomb. We only have Matthew's claim that they did. This is circular reasoning: we know the tomb was empty because opponents said it was empty, and we know opponents said it was empty because Matthew tells us they did. Matthew is the only source for the guards, the only source for the bribery story, and the only source for the stolen-body accusation. The historian cannot treat Matthew as a neutral reporter of what opponents said when Matthew has every theological motive to portray opponents this way. My opponent asks what alternative explanation fits the data—but the data itself is mediated through sources with a vested interest in the outcome. The most parsimonious explanation is that the empty tomb tradition developed within the early Christian community and Matthew framed it in a way that answered objections.

My opponent suggests that diverse religious experiences across cultures points to a genuine divine reality. But this is precisely what we'd expect if religious experience is a human phenomenon with common cognitive underpinnings. Cognitive science shows that humans have evolved tendencies to detect agency, find patterns, and cope with mortality—tendencies that produce religious experiences across cultures. The diversity of these experiences, often mutually exclusive in their theological claims, suggests they're shaped by cultural expectations rather than accessing objective truth. Muslims encounter Allah in visions, Hindus encounter Krishna, Christians encounter Jesus. The commonality is the experience of encountering a divine being; the difference is which being appears, tracking with cultural background. This pattern is explained by psychology, not by actual divine beings competing for attention.

On evil, my opponent says all worldviews have mysteries, and Christianity has fewer. But the problem of evil isn't a mystery in Christianity—it's a contradiction between an all-good, all-powerful God and the world as we find it. My opponent appeals to mystery to resolve this, but mystery that shields a belief from falsification is a weakness, not a strength. They say God defeats evil through the cross, but this doesn't explain why an omnipotent God would create a world with horrific evil in the first place. An omnipotent being could create a world without horrific evil while still allowing free will and soul-making. The fact that our world contains horrific evils—children suffering from diseases that existed millions of years before humans—is precisely what we'd expect if there were no God. Naturalism doesn't promise that evil will be defeated, but it doesn't need to explain why a benevolent God would allow it either. The world looks natural because it is natural.

Finally, my opponent argues that platonic moral truths are "metaphysically mysterious" and that Christianity grounds morality in God's nature. But the Euthyphro dilemma remains unanswered: if God's nature defines goodness, then goodness is whatever God's nature happens to be, which seems arbitrary. Why is God's nature good rather than cruel? If the answer is that God's nature necessarily possesses certain properties that we recognize as good, then those properties are good independently of God. The theist hasn't grounded morality in God; they've just pushed the question back one step. Moreover, secular moral realism doesn't require platonic forms. Moral facts could be natural facts about the well-being of conscious creatures—facts that are objectively true because suffering and flourishing are real experiences, not because they exist in some abstract realm. My opponent asks which worldview makes better sense of "the totality of our experience." I submit that naturalism makes better sense: the universe behaves according to natural laws without apparent supernatural intervention; religious experiences track with cultural background; consciousness and morality emerge from natural processes; and the resurrection evidence falls far short of establishing a supernatural event. The default position in the absence of compelling evidence is atheism—and I haven't seen compelling evidence.
