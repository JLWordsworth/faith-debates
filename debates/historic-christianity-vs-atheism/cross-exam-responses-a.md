# Cross-Examination Responses - Historic Christianity

## Response to Question 1

The tension between sufficient evidence and non-coercive faith is real but not contradictory. "Sufficient" evidence doesn't mean "coercive" evidence that compels assent regardless of one's disposition. The resurrection evidence is accessible to anyone who investigates it, but how one evaluates that evidence is influenced by prior assumptions about whether supernatural events are possible. A naturalist historian will interpret the evidence differently than one open to theism because they start with different worldview commitments. This isn't unique to religion—people examining the same historical data often reach different conclusions based on background beliefs. God's hiddenness from some sincere seekers may reflect that genuine faith involves not just evidence but trust and willingness to act. As Jesus said, "If anyone chooses to do God's will, they will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own" (John 7:17). The evidence is sufficient for those willing to follow where it leads, but resistible enough to allow those who prefer autonomy to maintain plausible deniability.

## Response to Question 2

This is an important question that requires distinguishing between God's nature and our understanding of it. God's nature as revealed in Scripture is fundamentally characterized by love, justice, mercy, and holiness. The difficult passages mentioned must be understood in their ancient Near Eastern context, where the Canaanites' destruction was portrayed as judgment after centuries of wickedness (Genesis 15:16), not arbitrary genocide. The Israelites themselves were eventually judged by the same standard. Regarding slavery, biblical "slavery" was often more like indentured servitude with legal protections and mandatory release—and the Bible's gradual redemption ethic moved culture toward freedom. Eternal punishment flows from God's justice: finite sins against an infinite God warrant infinite consequence, and rejection of God means choosing separation from the source of all goodness. I don't need to choose between "whatever God does is good by definition" and "God conforms to an independent standard." Rather, God's nature IS the standard of goodness, and our moral intuitions, while fallen, can generally recognize goodness when we see it. When Scripture seems to portray God acting contrary to His nature of love, we examine our interpretation more carefully. The Euthyphro dilemma assumes God and goodness are separate; Christianity says they are identical.

## Response to Question 3

Fine-tuning for life doesn't mean every part of the universe must be hospitable—only that the universe's physical parameters permit life somewhere. A universe with different constants wouldn't have life anywhere. The vast, inhospitable cosmos serves other purposes: displaying God's glory (Psalm 19:1), providing resources for scientific discovery, and preventing humanity from thinking we're the center of everything. Regarding extinction and animal suffering, Christianity teaches that the world is not now as God intended it. Death and suffering entered through human rebellion (Genesis 3, Romans 8:20-22), distorting God's original creation. The current "wasteful, cruel process" reflects a fallen world, not God's ideal design. God is using even this brokenness to achieve greater goods: developing virtues like courage and compassion, creating dependence on Him, and ultimately defeating evil through Christ. The resurrection guarantees that all suffering will be redeemed and that God's original purposes will be restored. This isn't "evidence doesn't fit the hypothesis but we believe anyway"—it's acknowledging that Christianity tells a story about why the world is both beautiful (created by God) and broken (fallen), and how it will be healed. Atheism has no resources to call animal suffering "wrong" or offer ultimate hope that it will be redeemed.
