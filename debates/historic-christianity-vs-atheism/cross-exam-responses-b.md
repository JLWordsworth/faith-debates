# Cross-Examination Responses - Debater B (Atheism)

## Response to Question 1

Why regard moral intuitions as tracking objective truth rather than being adaptive survival mechanisms? The answer is that both can be true. Our moral intuitions may have evolutionary origins while still tracking genuine moral truths about the well-being of conscious creatures. We don't dismiss mathematical intuitions as "merely adaptive" even though they evolved—we recognize that they track truths about numbers and structures. Similarly, moral intuitions can track truths about suffering and flourishing even if they evolved. But importantly, my position doesn't claim our moral intuitions are infallible; it claims moral truths exist and we reason toward them through empathy, reflection, and consideration of consequences.

On what basis do I condemn genocide objectively if a culture believes it promotes their flourishing? Genocide causes extreme suffering and destroys the lives of conscious creatures who have interests in continuing to live and thrive. The wrongness of genocide isn't dependent on any culture's opinion—it's grounded in the objective reality that conscious beings experience suffering and death, and that these are harms. A culture that believes genocide promotes their flourishing is factually mistaken about what flourishing requires and morally wrong in how they treat other conscious beings. Theism doesn't solve this problem either—if God commanded genocide (as the Old Testament portrays), would it be good? If yes, morality is arbitrary. If no, then goodness is independent of God. My secular grounding—suffering is bad, flourishing is good—provides a clear basis for condemning genocide without appealing to divine authority.

## Response to Question 2

Is confidence in future scientific discoveries an article of faith? There's a crucial difference between faith as belief without evidence and inductive confidence based on track record. I'm not asserting that future discoveries *will* explain consciousness; I'm asserting that naturalistic explanations have a track record of success that justifies continuing to seek them. For centuries, phenomena once attributed to divine action have been explained through natural processes. This inductive pattern justifies confidence that it will continue. This is not faith but reasonable extrapolation from past success.

What evidence suggests consciousness can be reduced to physical processes? Several lines of evidence point in this direction: (1) Brain damage systematically alters consciousness—specific mental capacities correlate with specific brain regions. (2) Anesthetics and drugs systematically alter conscious experience through physical means. (3) No confirmed cases of consciousness without brain activity. (4) The evolutionary emergence of consciousness in increasingly complex brains suggests it's a natural phenomenon. (5) The "hard problem" of consciousness is genuine, but multiple naturalistic theories exist (integrated information theory, global workspace, etc.). The fact that consciousness feels unlike physical properties doesn't mean it isn't one—solidity feels unlike molecular motion, but that's what it is. The question remains open, but naturalism has earned the right to keep searching.

## Response to Question 3

Would I consider other ancient events with multiple independent sources within decades to be historically reliable? Yes, for ordinary historical claims—battles, political events, deaths. But the resurrection is not an ordinary historical claim; it's a supernatural claim that violates everything we know about how the world works. Historians rightly apply higher standards to extraordinary claims. Multiple sources decades later reporting a supernatural event don't establish that it happened—they establish that people *believed* it happened. I'd accept that Jesus was crucified (ordinary event) without much hesitation. I don't accept that He rose from the dead (extraordinary event) without extraordinary evidence.

What alternative explanation accounts for all the historical data? No single alternative explanation is certain, but several are more plausible than resurrection: (1) The tomb was empty for unknown reasons, and the disciples interpreted Jesus' appearances as resurrection—hallucinations, visions, or wishful thinking playing a role. (2) The empty tomb story developed gradually as a theological interpretation of Jesus' continued significance to the community. (3) Different disciples had different experiences—visions, dreams, intense sense of presence—that were later unified into a single resurrection narrative. (4) The transformation of the disciples is impressive but not unique—followers of other religious leaders and movements have shown similar dedication and willingness to die. The conversion of Paul is best explained by a genuine religious experience, but religious experiences occur across all traditions and don't establish objective truth about their content. The rapid spread of Christianity in Jerusalem is impressive but not uniquely so—Islam spread even faster. The question isn't whether naturalistic explanations are certain, but whether they're more plausible than a supernatural event that contradicts our uniform experience of how the world works. They are.
