# Cross-Examination Questions - Debater B (Atheism)

## Question 1

You've argued that the resurrection is the best explanation for the historical facts, including the empty tomb and post-resurrection appearances. But you also acknowledge that God values relationship based on faith rather than coercive certainty. This creates a tension: if God provided enough evidence to convince sincere seekers through the resurrection, why does He remain hidden from millions of other sincere seekers who use the same historical method? If the resurrection evidence is supposed to be sufficient for reasonable trust, why do intelligent, honest historians who examine the same evidence come to different conclusions? Does God's desire for "non-coercive faith" explain why the evidence for resurrection is exactly the kind of evidence we'd expect for a non-supernatural event?

## Question 2

You've argued that Christianity grounds objective morality in God's nature, avoiding the Euthyphro dilemma because God's nature IS the good. But this raises a question: how do we know what God's nature is? We derive our understanding of God's nature from the Bible, which portrays God commanding and doing things that seem morally problematic by modern standards—including genocide of the Canaanites, eternal punishment for finite sins, and acceptance of slavery. If God's nature defines goodness, then these actions are good by definition. But if you say these actions are good for reasons we don't fully understand, then you've conceded that "goodness" is something independent of God's nature that we can use to evaluate His actions. Which is it: is whatever God does good by definition, or does God conform to an independent standard of goodness?

## Question 3

You've appealed to the fine-tuning of physical constants as evidence for a purposeful Creator. But if the universe was fine-tuned for life, why is the vast majority of it inhospitable to life? Even on Earth, 99% of all species that have ever lived are extinct, and life has survived multiple mass extinction events that nearly wiped it out entirely. The process that produced humans involved hundreds of millions of years of horrific animal suffering, including predation, disease, and extinction. If an all-good, all-powerful God fine-tuned the universe for life, why did He use such a wasteful, cruel process? And if you appeal to mystery—saying we can't understand God's methods—how is this different from saying the evidence doesn't fit the hypothesis but we'll believe it anyway?
