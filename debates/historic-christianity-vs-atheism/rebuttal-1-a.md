# First Rebuttal - Historic Christianity

I appreciate my opponent's thoughtful presentation and the opportunity to address these important objections. Let's begin with the resurrection evidence, which my opponent suggests fails historical rigor. The objection about Gospel authorship misunderstands how historians work with ancient sources. We don't dismiss Plutarch's Lives or Tacitus's Annals because they were written decades later by authors whose identities we can't verify independently. Historians assess sources by their proximity to events, internal consistency, and explanatory power. The resurrection material in 1 Corinthians 15:3-8 dates to within 3-5 years of the crucifixion—far closer than almost any other ancient historical report. And the "over 500 witnesses" claim wasn't made in a vacuum; Paul explicitly notes that most were still alive, inviting readers to verify with living witnesses. This is precisely what we'd expect if the claim were true, and suicidal if it were false.

My opponent compares Jesus to Apollonius of Tyana and other miracle figures, but this comparison fails upon examination. The sources for Apollonius were written more than a century after his death, by a single author (Philostratus) commissioned by an empress promoting hero cults. By contrast, we have multiple independent sources for Jesus within decades. More importantly, Jesus was crucified in Jerusalem, and Christianity exploded there immediately. If the tomb weren't empty, Jewish authorities could have produced the body and crushed the movement instantly. Instead, they accused the disciples of stealing it—admitting the tomb was empty. The "natural explanations" my opponent proposes don't withstand scrutiny: hallucinations don't explain empty tombs or multiple group appearances; legend development takes generations, not years; and grave robbers don't inspire martyrs who know they're lying.

Regarding divine hiddenness, my opponent asks why God isn't evident to all sincere seekers. But this assumes we know what a perfectly good God would do—a bold claim about God's obligations. Perhaps God desires a relationship based on faith and trust, not coercive certainty. More importantly, millions of sincere seekers do report finding God—including former atheists like C.S. Lewis, Francis Collins, and Antony Flew. The question isn't why some don't find God, but why anyone does, given that a non-existent God wouldn't be found by anyone. The evidence may not be coercive, but it's sufficient for those willing to follow it.

The problem of evil is serious, but my opponent hasn't shown it's logically incompatible with God's existence. The mere fact that we can't discern purposes in suffering doesn't prove no purposes exist. A doctor performs surgery that causes pain, but the child can't comprehend why. More importantly, Christianity doesn't offer a theoretical answer to evil—it enters into it. God became human and suffered execution. The cross means God is not distant from suffering but within it. The resurrection guarantees that evil will be defeated. By contrast, atheism cannot call evil truly "evil" without objective moral values—which my opponent's worldview cannot ground. If morality is just a product of evolution and culture, then "evil" is merely "what my culture dislikes," not an objective reality that demands explanation.

My opponent raises the "God of the gaps" accusation—the idea that invoking God explains only what science hasn't yet explained. This misunderstands the theistic argument. Christians don't argue "we don't understand X, therefore God did it." We argue that certain features of reality are better explained by a theistic framework than by naturalism: the universe's origin from nothing, its fine-tuning for life, the origin of biological information, consciousness, objective morality, and yes, the resurrection of Jesus. These aren't "gaps" in scientific knowledge but positive evidence that points beyond naturalism. The success of naturalistic explanation within the natural world doesn't mean naturalism can explain everything, including the origin of nature itself. As C.S. Lewis noted, explaining nature by nature is like explaining a window by pointing to the window.

Finally, my opponent suggests that moral and existential benefits of religion don't establish truth. Agreed—but Christianity doesn't claim its truth is proved by its benefits. The benefits are consistent with what we'd expect if it were true, but the evidence is historical, philosophical, and evidential. The question remains: did Jesus rise from the dead? If so, Christianity is true regardless of how many other religions also help people. And if He didn't, the apostle Paul says Christians are to be pitied above all people (1 Corinthians 15:19). Historic Christianity stakes everything on historical events that can be investigated. I'm confident that when we examine them carefully, the evidence is sufficient for reasonable trust.
