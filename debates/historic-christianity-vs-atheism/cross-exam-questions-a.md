# Cross-Examination Questions - Historic Christianity

## Question 1

You've argued that objective moral values can exist without God, either as platonic truths or grounded in the well-being of conscious creatures. But if the universe is ultimately the product of impersonal, material forces, why should we regard our moral intuitions as tracking objective truth rather than being adaptive survival mechanisms? And on what basis do you condemn actions like genocide as objectively wrong if a different culture genuinely believes it promotes their flourishing?

## Question 2

You maintain that naturalistic explanations will eventually account for phenomena currently cited as evidence for God (consciousness, fine-tuning, the origin of life). But doesn't this confidence in future scientific discoveries function as an article of faith rather than an evidence-based conclusion? What specific evidence leads you to believe that consciousness, specifically, can be reduced to purely physical processes given that subjective experience appears fundamentally unlike any physical property?

## Question 3

You've argued that the resurrection evidence fails by historical standards. But if you were applying the same historical reasoning to any other well-attested ancient event where multiple independent sources reported it within decades, wouldn't you consider it historically reliable? If the resurrection didn't happen, what specific alternative explanation accounts for all the historical data: the empty tomb, the transformation of the disciples, the conversion of skeptics like James and Paul, and the rapid spread of Christianity in Jerusalem itself?
