# Opening Statement - Historic Christianity

Ladies and gentlemen, today I present the case for Historic Christianity—the faith that has shaped Western civilization, transformed countless lives, and continues to offer compelling answers to life's deepest questions. What distinguishes Christianity from mere philosophy or spiritual speculation is that it makes claims about real, historical events that can be investigated. Christianity does not ask for blind faith; it invites honest inquiry into whether God has acted definitively in human history, most notably in the person of Jesus of Nazareth.

The cornerstone of Historic Christianity is the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This is not a myth that developed gradually over centuries, but a proclamation that emerged immediately in Jerusalem—the very city where Jesus was publicly executed. Consider the evidence: the empty tomb, acknowledged even by critics who accused the disciples of stealing the body; post-resurrection appearances to over 500 people at once, many of whom were still alive when the New Testament was written and could be interviewed; and the radical transformation of Jesus' followers from fearful fugitives into bold martyrs willing to die for their testimony. People will die for what they believe to be true, but they will not die for what they know to be a lie. The resurrection explains these historical facts better than any alternative theory, and it validates Jesus' claims to be the divine Son of God.

Beyond the resurrection, Christianity offers a cumulative case that spans multiple fields of inquiry. The Old Testament contains dozens of specific prophecies about the Messiah—written centuries before Jesus' birth—that He fulfilled in remarkable detail, including His birthplace in Bethlehem, His ministry of healing and preaching, and vivid descriptions of His crucifixion in Psalm 22 and Isaiah 53, written before crucifixion was even invented. Cosmology confirms that the universe had a beginning, pointing to a transcendent cause. The fine-tuning of physical constants for life suggests purposeful design. The existence of objective moral values and human dignity finds its foundation in humans being created in God's image. And the transformed lives of millions across two millennia—from persecutors like Paul to slave traders like John Newton—testify to Christianity's power to change people from the inside out.

Christianity provides a coherent framework that makes sense of reality as we experience it. It explains why the universe is orderly and intelligible, why humans have moral consciousness and long for meaning, why the world is both beautiful and broken, and how it can ultimately be redeemed. I look forward to exploring these arguments and responding to my opponent's perspective, confident that Historic Christianity offers not just comfort, but truth—grounded in evidence and worthy of our trust.
