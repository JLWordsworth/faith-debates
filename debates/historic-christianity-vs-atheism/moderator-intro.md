# Moderator Introduction

## Debate Topic: Historic Christianity vs Atheism

### Topic Overview

This debate explores one of the most fundamental questions in human existence: Does God exist, and specifically, is the Christian faith a true account of reality? This is not merely an abstract philosophical discussion, but an inquiry that touches on the nature of reality, the basis of morality, the meaning of life, and humanity's ultimate destiny.

### Position A: Historic Christianity

Historic Christianity represents the orthodox, foundational Christian faith rooted in the historical death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This position affirms that:

- God exists eternally as Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
- Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man, who died for human sin and rose bodily from the dead
- The Bible is the inspired, authoritative Word of God
- Salvation is by God's grace through faith in Christ alone
- Christianity is grounded in objective, historical events that can be investigated evidentially

Historic Christianity emphasizes that faith is not blind, but based on real historical events—including the resurrection of Jesus—which serve as the cornerstone of Christian belief.

### Position B: Atheism

Atheism is the philosophical position that there are no deities or supernatural beings. This position maintains that:

- The natural world is all that exists; no supernatural entity is required to explain reality
- Claims about God's existence have not met their burden of proof
- Science and reason provide sufficient explanations for all phenomena
- Morality, meaning, and value are human-created through evolution, culture, and rational deliberation
- Religion itself can be explained naturalistically as a product of human cognition and culture

Atheism emphasizes that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and that theistic claims have not met this standard.
