# First Rebuttal - Complementarian Position

My opponent has presented a thoughtful case for egalitarianism, emphasizing the dignity and value of women—points I heartily affirm. We agree that men and women are equal in God's image, equal in salvation, and equal recipients of spiritual gifts. We agree that women have served God magnificently throughout Scripture and church history. The question before us is not whether women are valuable or gifted, but whether God has established distinct roles for men and women in the home and church.

## Mutual Submission Does Not Erase Distinct Roles

My opponent appeals to Ephesians 5:21—"Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ"—as the governing principle that erases role distinctions. However, this verse introduces the household code that follows; it does not nullify the specific instructions within it. Paul immediately applies this principle: "Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord" (Ephesians 5:22). The call to mutual submission does not mean everyone submits to everyone in identical ways; rather, it means each person fulfills their God-given role in a spirit of humility and service. Just as Christ submits to the Father (1 Corinthians 11:3) though equal in divinity, so wives submit to their husbands while equal in dignity. The passage assumes distinct roles even as it calls all to mutual submission.

## Galatians 3:28 and Role Distinctions

My opponent cites Galatians 3:28 to argue that all role distinctions are erased in Christ. But if this verse eliminates all gender-based role distinctions, it must also eliminate all ethnic and social distinctions. Yet Scripture elsewhere affirms that children still honor parents (Ephesians 6:1-3), masters still oversee servants (Ephesians 6:5-9, though with transformed attitudes), and Jews and Greeks remain distinct ethnic groups with different callings. Galatians 3:28 speaks of equal standing in salvation and access to God's blessings—not the erasure of all functional distinctions within the body of Christ.

## The Spirit's Gifts and Church Office

My opponent argues that because the Spirit gifts women for teaching and leadership, they should hold all church offices. I agree that the Spirit gifts women richly for many forms of ministry. But the existence of a gift does not automatically qualify someone for every office. The Spirit gifts young men to teach, but they cannot be elders (1 Timothy 3:6). The Spirit may gift men who are not "above reproach" or "able to teach," and they too are disqualified. The existence of spiritual gifts is one qualification; the office qualifications—including being male—are another. Women can and should teach women (Titus 2:3-4), teach children, prophesy, and serve in countless vital ways. But the authoritative teaching office of elder, which requires teaching with authority over the entire congregation including men, is reserved for qualified men.

## Women in Scripture: Leadership Without the Office

My opponent cites examples of women leading in Scripture—Deborah, Priscilla, Phoebe, Junia. I celebrate these examples, but they do not prove women held the office of elder. Deborah was a judge and prophetess under the old covenant, a unique situation in which God raised her up because "there was no man to lead" (implicit in the narrative). Priscilla taught Apollos privately with her husband—a far cry from exercising authoritative teaching over a congregation. Phoebe was a servant (diakonos) and patron—not an elder. Junia was "prominent among the apostles" (or "well known to the apostles"), but even if she was an apostle in the general sense of "messenger," this is not identical to the office of elder/overseer that emerged in the settled church. These examples show women serving God powerfully, but not in violation of the male elder qualification.

## Creation Order: Not Cultural but Foundational

My opponent suggests that Paul's appeal to creation order in 1 Timothy 2:13-14 and 1 Corinthians 11:8-9 was addressing specific cultural situations. But if the creation order is merely cultural, then Paul's argument collapses. Why would he ground his teaching in creation if he meant only to address a temporary cultural problem? The creation order is precisely what makes the teaching transcultural—because it reflects God's original design, not first-century conventions. Similarly, Paul's reference to Eve's deception (1 Timothy 2:14) cannot be reduced to a comment about uneducated Ephesian women, for he presents it as a universal pattern: "Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and fell into transgression."

## The Nature of Headship

My opponent suggests that headship language in the New Testament reflects cultural accommodation rather than God's ideal. But Scripture presents headship as reflecting the Trinity itself—the Son, equal to the Father, submits to the Father's authority. This is not a cultural artifact but a divine pattern. To say that headship belongs to the curse is to misunderstand both the curse and redemption. The curse brought distortion and domination into male-female relationships, but Christ's redemption restores the proper order: wives submit "as to the Lord" (Ephesians 5:22), and husbands love sacrificially (Ephesians 5:25). The New Testament does not abolish headship; it purifies it from sin's corruption.

## The Meaning of Authentein

My opponent suggests that authentein in 1 Timothy 2:12 means "to domineer" or "usurp authority," and that Paul only prohibits a specific kind of abusive behavior. Even if we grant this interpretation, it does not lead to egalitarian conclusions. If Paul only prohibits domineering authority, who may exercise proper, loving authority? The rest of Scripture indicates that qualified men are to exercise this authority in the home and church. Moreover, Paul immediately grounds his prohibition in creation, suggesting a permanent pattern rather than a temporary correction.

## Conclusion

My opponent and I share a deep commitment to Scripture and to the dignity and value of women. We agree that women have many vital ministries in the church. The question is whether God has established distinct roles. I contend that He has, and that these roles are rooted in creation, reflected in the Trinity, designed to display the gospel, and reaffirmed in the New Testament for Spirit-filled believers. I look forward to my opponent's response and to further exploring these crucial matters.
