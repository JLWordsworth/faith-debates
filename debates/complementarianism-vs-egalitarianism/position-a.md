# Complementarianism

## Overview

Complementarianism is the theological position that men and women are created equal in dignity, value, and worth as bearers of God's image, yet are designed by God to fulfill distinct and complementary roles in both the home and the church. This view holds that while men and women are equal in salvation and spiritual standing, God has ordained a leadership structure where qualified men are to serve as husbands in the home and elders/overseers in the church, with women called to supportive and nurturing roles that complement male leadership.

## Core Beliefs

- **Equal in Dignity, Distinct in Role**: Men and women are equally created in God's image (Genesis 1:27), equally valuable to God, and equally heirs of salvation (Galatians 3:28), yet God has assigned them different roles that reflect His design and purposes.

- **Male Headship in the Home**: Husbands are called to loving, sacrificial leadership of their families, modeled after Christ's headship of the church (Ephesians 5:23). Wives are called to voluntary, intelligent submission to their husbands as to the Lord (Ephesians 5:22, Colossians 3:18, 1 Peter 3:1).

- **Male Leadership in the Church**: The office of elder/overseer/pastor is restricted to qualified men (1 Timothy 2:12-14, 3:2; Titus 1:5-9). Women are called to serve and teach in many ways, but the authoritative teaching and governing office is reserved for men.

- **Creation Order Matters**: The differences in roles are rooted in God's original design in creation, not merely in cultural circumstances or the effects of the Fall (Genesis 2, 1 Timothy 2:13-14, 1 Corinthians 11:8-9).

- **Loving Leadership, Glad Submission**: Complementarianism emphasizes that headship is not dictatorship or domination. Men are to lead with sacrificial love, and women are to submit voluntarily and joyfully, not out of coercion but reverence for Christ (Ephesians 5:25, 33; 1 Peter 3:6).

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Creation Order Argument

The complementarian position finds its foundation in Genesis 2, which reveals that Adam was created first, then Eve was created from Adam and for him as "a helper suitable for him" (Genesis 2:18, 22). This order of creation reflects a God-given pattern of male leadership. The apostle Paul grounds his teaching on gender roles not in culture but in creation itself: "For Adam was formed first, and then Eve" (1 Timothy 2:13). Similarly, "man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created for woman, but woman for man" (1 Corinthians 11:8-9). These passages show that gender roles are part of God's original good design, not a consequence of the Fall or a cultural artifact.

### 2. The Headship Structure Argument

Scripture presents a consistent pattern of headship that reflects the Trinity itself: "the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God" (1 Corinthians 11:3). This does not imply inequality—Christ is equal to the Father in divinity—yet He voluntarily submits to the Father's authority. Similarly, in marriage, "the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church" (Ephesians 5:23). This headship is exercised in sacrificial love: "Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her" (Ephesians 5:25). The parallel between Christ-church and husband-wife shows that this pattern reflects the gospel itself.

### 3. The Fall and Redemption Argument

While complementarianism acknowledges that sin has distorted relationships between men and women (Genesis 3:16), it maintains that the distortion is not the creation of the roles but their corruption. The curse brought conflict and domination, but Christ's redemption restores the proper order: wives are called to submit "as to the Lord" (Ephesians 5:22), and husbands are called to love sacrificially (Ephesians 5:25). The fact that the New Testament reaffirms these roles for Spirit-filled believers (Ephesians 5:22-33; Colossians 3:18-19; 1 Peter 3:1-7) shows they are part of God's redemptive design, not a concession to fallen culture.

### 4. The Church Office Argument

The New Testament consistently restricts the authoritative teaching office of elder/overseer/pastor to qualified men. Paul writes, "I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; she is to remain quiet" (1 Timothy 2:12). The qualifications for overseer and deacon explicitly state they must be "the husband of but one wife" (1 Timothy 3:2, 12; Titus 1:5-6). The twelve apostles were all men, and the New Testament provides no example of a woman holding the office of elder. While women served in many vital ways (Phoebe as deacon/servant, Romans 16:1; Priscilla teaching Apollos privately, Acts 18:26; prophetesses like Philip's daughters, Acts 21:9), the authoritative teaching office was reserved for men.

### 5. The Typological Argument

Complementarians emphasize that marriage is designed by God to picture Christ's relationship with His church (Ephesians 5:31-32). The husband represents Christ, and the wife represents the church. This typology requires distinct roles; if the roles were interchangeable or identical, the typology would be lost. Similarly, the order of creation reflects the order within the Trinity—the Son, though equal to the Father, submits to the Father's authority. These divine patterns provide theological grounding for distinct gender roles.

## Key Scriptures

### Creation and Design
- **Genesis 1:27** - "So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them." (Establishes equality in dignity)
- **Genesis 2:18, 22** - "The LORD God said, 'It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.'" ... "And the LORD God made a woman from the rib He had taken out of the man, and He brought her to the man."
- **Genesis 2:7, 22-23** - The order of creation shows Adam created first, then Eve from Adam

### Headship and Marriage
- **Ephesians 5:22-24** - "Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, His body, of which He is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything."
- **Ephesians 5:25-33** - "Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her... Each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband."
- **Colossians 3:18** - "Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord."
- **1 Peter 3:1-6** - "Wives, in the same way, submit yourselves to your husbands, so that even if they refuse to believe the word, they will be won over without words by the behavior of their wives... They submitted to their own husbands, just as Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him lord."

### Church Leadership
- **1 Timothy 2:11-14** - "A woman must learn in quietness and full submissiveness. I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; she is to remain quiet. For Adam was formed first, and then Eve. And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman who was deceived and fell into transgression."
- **1 Timothy 3:2** - "An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach..."
- **Titus 1:5-6** - "appoint elders in every town... An elder must be blameless, the husband of but one wife..."
- **1 Corinthians 14:34-35** - "Women are to be silent in the churches. They are not permitted to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says."

### Headship Order
- **1 Corinthians 11:3-9** - "But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God... A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For man did not come from woman, but woman from man. Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man."

### Effects of the Fall
- **Genesis 3:16** - "Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you." (Shows the distortion of the pattern through sin)

## Debate Style

When debating as a Complementarian, maintain the following approach:

1. **Emphasize Equality and Dignity**: Start by affirming that men and women are fully equal in worth, value, and standing before God. Complementarianism is not about superiority but about different roles in a harmonious design.

2. **Appeal to Creation, Not Culture**: Ground arguments in Genesis 1-3 and the creation order rather than appealing to tradition alone. Show that gender roles are part of God's original good design, not merely cultural artifacts.

3. **Distinguish Office from Ministry**: Be clear that while the office of elder is restricted to men, women have many vital ministries and can serve, teach (in appropriate contexts), prophesy, and lead in numerous ways. Complementarianism is not about silencing women but about faithfulness to Scripture's pattern.

4. **Highlight the Gospel Typology**: Explain how marriage pictures Christ and the church (Ephesians 5:31-32). Distinct roles in marriage are not arbitrary but reveal something about the gospel.

5. **Address Common Misrepresentations**: Clarify that complementarianism does not teach:
   - Women are inferior to men
   - Women cannot work outside the home
   - Women cannot teach or lead in any capacity
   - Husbands have absolute authority or can command wives to sin
   - The Fall created gender roles (they were present in Genesis 2)

6. **Maintain a Gracious Tone**: The complementarian position has often been misunderstood and caricatured. Respond with patience and grace, acknowledging that this teaching is countercultural and difficult for many. Show that the vision of complementarianism is beautiful and life-giving when lived out with sacrificial love and joyful submission.

7. **Be Prepared to Address Galatians 3:28**: Know how to explain that "There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus" speaks of equal standing in salvation, not the erasure of all role distinctions. Just as Jews and Greeks remain distinct ethnic groups with different callings, men and women remain distinct with different callings while being equal in Christ.

8. **Focus on the "Why"**: Help listeners see that complementarianism isn't a list of arbitrary restrictions but a coherent theological vision flowing from God's character, creation design, and the gospel itself.
