# Cross-Examination Responses - Complementarian Position

## Response to Question 1: The Dominion Mandate

This is an excellent question that touches on an important aspect of creation. The dominion mandate in Genesis 1:27-28 is indeed given to both man and woman jointly, and I affirm this fully. Men and women together share authority over creation as God's vice-regents. However, this shared dominion does not erase distinct roles within the human family. The fact that both parents share authority over their children does not mean they have identical roles; both may discipline and teach, but Scripture assigns unique responsibilities to each. Similarly, the shared dominion mandate establishes human authority over creation generally, while Genesis 2 reveals distinct roles within the human family itself. The creation order—Adam first, then Eve from Adam and for him—exists alongside and informs how they exercise their shared dominion. The dominion mandate shows that women rule alongside men over creation, not that no distinctions exist between men and women in how they relate to each other.

## Response to Question 2: Eve's Deception and Women's Character

This question raises a valid concern that I want to address carefully. Paul's reference to Eve's deception in 1 Timothy 2:14 does not imply that women are inherently more gullible or deceptive than men—this would indeed contradict their equal status as image-bearers. Rather, Paul is noting a historical pattern: in the Genesis narrative, Eve was deceived while Adam was not. Adam sinned with his eyes open, which is in some ways more culpable. Paul's point is not about women's inherent nature but about the creation order and the fall: Adam was created first, then Eve; Eve was deceived, not Adam. This establishes a pattern that Paul sees as relevant to his instruction. The prohibition is not based on a deficiency in women's character or intellect but on God's created order and the roles established therein. Women are equally intelligent, capable, and spiritually discerning—as Scripture abundantly demonstrates—but God has assigned different roles for His own wise purposes.

## Response to Question 3: Prophecy and Teaching

This question gets to the heart of an important distinction. Throughout Scripture, women serve as prophets—Miriam, Deborah, Huldah, Philip's daughters, and others. Prophecy is a gift of the Spirit, and the Spirit distributes gifts without regard to gender. However, the office of prophet is not identical to the office of elder/overseer/pastor. Prophecy involves delivering messages from God, often spontaneously and sometimes apart from established authority structures. The office of elder involves the settled, authoritative teaching and governing of the church—a continuous role of oversight. In the New Testament, prophets and elders are distinct roles (Ephesians 4:11). Moreover, under the old covenant, God raised up exceptional women like Deborah to judge Israel in a time of crisis—"there was no man to lead" (Judges 4:4, implied). But exceptional measures in extraordinary times do not establish the norm for ordinary church life. The New Testament provides no example of a woman serving as an elder or exercising the authoritative teaching office in a settled church congregation, even as it celebrates women's prophetic and other ministries.

I appreciate these thoughtful questions. They have allowed me to clarify important aspects of the complementarian position and to distinguish what we actually believe from common caricatures. I look forward to the closing statement phase.
