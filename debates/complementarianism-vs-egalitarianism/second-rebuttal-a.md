# Second Rebuttal - Complementarian Position

My opponent's response has helpfully clarified several points of disagreement. I appreciate the gracious tone and the shared commitment to Scripture. In this final rebuttal, I want to address key areas where our interpretations diverge and clarify why I believe the complementarian position best honors God's Word.

## The Meaning of Head (Kephale)

My opponent suggests that "head" (kephale) in 1 Corinthians 11:3 means "source" rather than "authority." While kephale can mean source in certain contexts, the evidence strongly favors the meaning of authority here. First, the parallel structure—"the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God"—suggests a hierarchy of authority. Christ's authority over man is undisputed; God's authority over Christ is affirmed throughout Scripture (John 14:28, 1 Corinthians 15:28). The consistent pattern is authority, not source. Second, the context concerns head coverings as symbols of authority (1 Corinthians 11:10), not origins. Third, Ephesians 5:23 explicitly states, "the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church"—a passage where headship clearly means authority, as Christ's headship over the church involves leadership, care, and authority. The meaning of "head" as authority fits both passages and reflects the consistent biblical pattern.

## The Trinity and Eternal Submission

My opponent raises concerns about the doctrine of eternal functional subordination in the Trinity. This is an important theological question, but we need not settle it to make our case. Even if the Son's submission is only during his incarnation, it still demonstrates that equality of nature does not preclude differences in role. The Son, fully equal to the Father in divinity, voluntarily submits to the Father's authority during his earthly ministry. This demonstrates that functional subordination is compatible with essential equality—a point that stands regardless of whether we extend this to eternity past. The Son's submission during the incarnation is not a temporary concession but a revelation of how equals relate in love. This pattern provides a model for how husbands and wives can be equal in dignity yet distinct in role.

## 1 Timothy 2 and Universal Application

My opponent suggests that Paul's instruction in 1 Timothy 2:11-15 was addressing a specific situation of uneducated women spreading false teaching. Several points deserve emphasis. First, Paul grounds his instruction in creation: "For Adam was formed first, and then Eve. And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman who was deceived and fell into transgression" (1 Timothy 2:13-14). Appeals to creation are precisely what make an instruction transcultural rather than temporary. If Paul meant only to address a temporary cultural problem, why ground it in the permanent order of creation? Second, the reference to Eve's deception suggests a pattern that extends beyond Ephesus. Third, the instruction is part of Paul's broader teaching on gender roles that appears in multiple letters (1 Corinthians 11, 14; Ephesians 5; Colossians 3; 1 Peter 3), suggesting a consistent pattern rather than isolated contextual corrections.

## The Nature of Authentein

My opponent notes that authentein is a rare Greek term carrying connotations of domineering. Even if we grant this interpretation, it does not lead to egalitarian conclusions. Paul prohibits women from teaching or exercising authority in a domineering way. But who may exercise proper, loving authority? The rest of Scripture indicates that qualified men are to serve as elders. Moreover, Paul's instruction for women to "learn in quietness and full submissiveness" (1 Timothy 2:11) parallels his instruction for all believers regarding peaceful and quiet lives (1 Timothy 2:2). The issue is not merely domineering but the assumption of a teaching role that belongs to qualified men. The universal church for nearly two thousand years read this passage as establishing a universal principle, not merely addressing a temporary abuse.

## Women Leaders and the Office of Elder

My opponent cites examples of women in leadership positions to argue that they held the office of elder. But we must distinguish between leadership and office. Deborah was a judge and prophetess under the old covenant—a unique situation. The old covenant includes many things not normative for the church (polygamy, prophets speaking new revelation, etc.). Priscilla's instruction of Apollos was private teaching with her husband, not exercising authoritative teaching over a congregation. Phoebe as diakonos may well have been a recognized servant, but the formal office of deacon as described in 1 Timothy 3 involves qualifications not mentioned here. Junia was "prominent among the apostles" or "well known to the apostles"—even if the former, "apostle" in the broad sense of "messenger" is not identical to the office of elder/overseer. The New Testament provides no example of a woman serving as an elder or exercising the authoritative teaching office in a settled church congregation.

## The Curse and Redemption

My opponent argues that headship is part of the curse and that Christ redeems us from it. But this misreads both the curse and Scripture's teaching. The curse in Genesis 3:16 describes the distortion of relationships: conflict and domination. Sin corrupts God's design, bringing pain and oppression. But Christ's redemption does not abolish God's design; it restores it from sin's corruption. The New Testament reaffirms headship for Spirit-filled believers (Ephesians 5:22-33; Colossians 3:18-19; 1 Peter 3:1-7), showing that it is part of God's redemptive design, not a concession to fallen culture. The fact that Paul must instruct believers in these roles indicates that sin had corrupted them; the solution is not to abolish the roles but to redeem them from sin's distortion.

## The Qualifications for Elder

My opponent suggests that "husband of one wife" (1 Timothy 3:2) is not a gender requirement but a character qualification. But the natural reading is that elders must be men who are faithful husbands. This interpretation is supported by the parallel instructions for deacons (1 Timothy 3:12) and the repeated pattern of male leadership throughout Scripture. Moreover, if this were merely about marital faithfulness regardless of gender, we might expect "spouse of one spouse" or language that includes women. Instead, the language assumes male elders. This is consistent with Paul's instruction that "I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man" (1 Timothy 2:12). The qualifications presuppose male elders, and the explicit instruction restricts the office to men.

## The Gospel Typology of Marriage

My opponent has not yet addressed one of complementarianism's strongest arguments: the typological relationship between marriage and Christ-church. Ephesians 5:31-32 states, "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church." Marriage is designed by God to picture Christ's relationship with His people. The husband represents Christ, and the wife represents the church. This typology requires distinct roles; if the roles were interchangeable or identical, the typology would be obscured. The gospel itself is at stake in how we understand marriage. Complementarianism preserves this God-given picture; egalitarianism blurs it.

## Conclusion

My opponent and I share a deep love for Scripture and a desire to be faithful to God's Word. We agree on the fundamentals of the faith and the equal dignity of men and women. The question is whether God has established distinct roles. I contend that He has, and that these roles are:

1. Rooted in creation, not culture (Genesis 2; 1 Timothy 2:13; 1 Corinthians 11:8-9)
2. Reflect the Trinity's pattern of equality with functional distinction (1 Corinthians 11:3)
3. Display the gospel in marriage (Ephesians 5:22-33)
4. Reaffirmed for Spirit-filled believers (Ephesians 5; Colossians 3; 1 Peter 3)
5. Restrict the authoritative teaching office to qualified men (1 Timothy 2:11-14; 3:2; Titus 1:5-6)

These roles are not about superiority or inferiority but about God's wise and loving design. When lived out with sacrificial love and joyful submission, they display the glory of God and the beauty of the gospel. I am grateful for this opportunity to present the complementarian case, and I look forward to the cross-examination phase.
