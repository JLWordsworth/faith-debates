# Opening Statement: Complementarian Position

## Equality in Dignity, Distinction in Role

Complementarianism begins with a foundational truth: men and women are created equal in dignity, worth, and value as bearers of God's image. Genesis 1:27 declares, "So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them." Both men and women fully reflect God's character and are equally heirs of His grace. Galatians 3:28 confirms this spiritual equality: "There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." Our position does not assert superiority of one gender over another; rather, we affirm that God, in His wisdom and love, has designed men and women for distinct and complementary roles that beautifully display His glory and the gospel itself.

## Rooted in Creation, Not Culture

The complementarian vision is grounded in God's original design before the Fall, not in cultural conventions or the consequences of sin. In Genesis 2, we see that Adam was created first, then Eve was created from Adam and for him as "a helper suitable for him" (Genesis 2:18, 22). This creation order reveals a God-given pattern of male leadership that the apostle Paul later invokes when he writes, "For Adam was formed first, and then Eve" (1 Timothy 2:13). Similarly, Paul teaches that "man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created for woman, but woman for man" (1 Corinthians 11:8-9). These passages demonstrate that gender distinctions in role are part of God's original good creation—not a result of the Fall, not a cultural artifact to be discarded, and not a punishment to be overcome. The differences between men and women, including their respective roles, were part of a creation that God declared "very good" (Genesis 1:31).

## Headship as Gospel Display

Scripture presents a consistent pattern of headship that ultimately reflects the relationship within the Trinity itself: "the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God" (1 Corinthians 11:3). This headship does not imply inequality of worth—Christ is fully equal to the Father in divinity—yet He voluntarily submits to the Father's authority. In marriage, this pattern reveals a profound gospel truth: "the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church" (Ephesians 5:23). Marriage is designed to picture Christ's relationship with His people, with the husband representing Christ and the wife representing the church. This typology requires distinct roles; if the roles were interchangeable, the picture would be obscured. Husbands are called to lead with sacrificial love, "just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her" (Ephesians 5:25), while wives are called to voluntary, joyful submission "as to the Lord" (Ephesians 5:22). This is not about domination or coercion, but about a beautiful dance of love and respect that displays the gospel to the world.

## Faithfulness in Church Leadership

The same pattern of male headship applies to the church. Christ, the head of the church, appointed twelve men as His apostles, and the New Testament consistently restricts the authoritative teaching office of elder/overseer/pastor to qualified men. Paul instructs, "I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; she is to remain quiet" (1 Timothy 2:12), grounding this command in creation rather than culture. The qualifications for overseer explicitly require "the husband of but one wife" (1 Timothy 3:2; Titus 1:6). This does not silence women or diminish their ministry—Scripture celebrates women's vital contributions as deacons (Romans 16:1), prophets (Acts 21:9), teachers (Titus 2:3-4), and fellow laborers in the gospel (Romans 16:3, 6). But the authoritative teaching and governing office is reserved for men, preserving the God-given pattern of headship that reflects both creation and the gospel.

## A Beautiful and Life-Giving Vision

Far from being oppressive, complementarianism offers a vision of relationships that is both beautiful and liberating. When husbands lead with sacrificial love rather than tyranny, and when wives respond with joyful submission rather than resentment, marriages flourish and children thrive. When churches honor God's pattern of male leadership in the eldership while fully utilizing the gifts of women in appropriate ministries, the body of Christ is built up in unity and diversity. We do not embrace these roles because they are popular or because they align with contemporary sensibilities—we embrace them because they are revealed in Scripture, rooted in creation, and designed to display the glory of God and the gospel of His grace.
