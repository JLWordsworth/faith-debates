# Cross-Examination Questions - Complementarian Position

## Question 1

You've argued that the creation order establishes permanent male leadership. But how do you explain the fact that the dominion mandate in Genesis 1:27-28 is given to both the man and the woman jointly: "God blessed them and said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it'"? If God intended permanent male authority over woman, why does the creation narrative place both genders equally under the same command to exercise dominion over creation?

## Question 2

You've cited 1 Timothy 2:11-15 as establishing a universal prohibition against women teaching or exercising authority over men. Yet Paul grounds this in creation by referencing Eve's deception. But if Eve's deception establishes a universal principle about women's unsuitability for teaching, wouldn't this also imply that women are more inherently gullible or deceptive than men—a conclusion that would contradict their equal status as image-bearers? How do you avoid this implication?

## Question 3

You've acknowledged that women can serve as prophets, and Scripture shows women like Deborah, Huldah, and Philip's daughters speaking for God authoritatively. If a prophetess can speak God's word to men—indeed, to kings and nations—on what biblical basis do you prohibit a woman from teaching Scripture to a mixed congregation? What is the theological distinction between prophetic speech to men and teaching Scripture to men that justifies permitting one while prohibiting the other?
