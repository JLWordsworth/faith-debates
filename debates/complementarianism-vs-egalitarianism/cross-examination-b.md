# Cross-Examination Questions - Egalitarian Position

## Question 1

You've argued that the Fall introduced domination as a distortion, and that Christ redeems us from the curse. But if male headship is merely part of the curse, why does the New Testament—written after Christ's redemptive work—instruct Spirit-filled believers in headship and submission? Specifically, why would Paul instruct wives in Ephesus, Colosse, and throughout the Roman Empire to submit to their husbands "as to the Lord" if he believed Christ had abolished this pattern?

## Question 2

You've argued that the Holy Spirit gifts women equally for all forms of ministry, including teaching and leadership. But the existence of a spiritual gift does not automatically qualify someone for every office of the church. For example, a young man may have the gift of teaching, yet 1 Timothy 3:6 disqualifies him from eldership if he is a new convert. Similarly, a man may have leadership gifts but be disqualified if he is not "above reproach" or "able to teach." On what basis do you argue that the existence of teaching gifts in women necessarily qualifies them for the authoritative office of elder, despite Paul's explicit statement that he does not permit a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man?

## Question 3

You've argued that marriage pictures Christ and the church but that this typology does not require distinct roles. However, Ephesians 5:23 explicitly states, "the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church." Paul then elaborates this parallel in detail: Christ as head of the church, husband as head of the wife; Christ as Savior of the body, husband as provider for the wife; the church submitting to Christ, the wife submitting to the husband. How do you understand the headship language in this passage if not as referring to leadership authority? And if headship means authority, does not the typology itself require distinct roles?
