# Cross-Examination Responses - Egalitarian Position

## Response to Question 1: New Testament Headship Instructions

This is a crucial question that goes to the heart of our debate. The key issue is how we understand the New Testament's household codes. I do not claim that Christ "abolished" all existing structures, but that He transforms them from within. When Paul instructs believers in existing social structures—whether wives, husbands, children, slaves, or masters—he does two things simultaneously: (1) He works within existing structures because radical social upheaval would undermine the gospel's advance and bring persecution on the young church; (2) He subverts these structures from within by calling believers to live out transformed relationships that embody kingdom values.

Consider slavery: Paul instructs slaves to obey masters and masters to treat slaves kindly (Ephesians 6:5-9; Colossians 3:22-4:1). He does not explicitly condemn slavery, yet the trajectory of his teaching—especially Philemon and Galatians 3:28—points toward abolition. The early church eventually recognized that slavery is incompatible with the gospel. Similarly, the household codes instruct wives and husbands within the patriarchal structure of first-century society, but they simultaneously subvert it by calling husbands to radical, sacrificial love that goes far beyond the wife's submission. The trajectory of Scripture—from creation equality to new creation restoration—points toward mutual partnership. The New Testament's repetition of submission language is not an endorsement of patriarchy as God's final ideal but a redemptive working within existing structures to transform them.

## Response to Question 2: Spiritual Gifts and Church Office

This question rightly notes that having a gift does not automatically qualify someone for every office. Young converts may be gifted teachers but disqualified from eldership until they mature. Men with leadership gifts may be disqualified if they lack character. However, there is a crucial difference between these disqualifications and a gender-based disqualification. Disqualifications based on spiritual maturity, character, or experience are universally applicable to all believers regardless of gender. But a disqualification based on gender alone is fundamentally different—it says that no matter how godly, gifted, mature, or experienced a woman is, she cannot serve as elder.

This is where the full witness of Scripture becomes crucial. Women throughout Scripture exercise the very functions that elders perform: teaching doctrine (Priscilla instructing Apollos), serving in recognized ministry (Phoebe as diakonos), exercising apostolic authority (Junia prominent among the apostles), leading God's people (Deborah as judge), and speaking for God (prophetesses throughout Scripture). If women can exercise these functions, on what basis do we prohibit them from the office? The only passages cited for prohibition are 1 Timothy 2:11-15 and 1 Corinthians 14:34-35, both of which must be understood in their historical-cultural contexts as addressing specific abuses, not establishing universal principles. The weight of Scripture's witness to women's leadership, combined with the absence of any substantive theological reason for restricting them, leads to the conclusion that the office should be open to qualified women.

## Response to Question 3: Headship in Ephesians 5

This question focuses on the heart of our disagreement. The key issue is the meaning of "head" (kephale) in Ephesians 5:23. As I noted in my rebuttal, kephale can mean "source" or "origin" as well as "authority over." In the context of Ephesians 5, Paul has just said in verse 21, "Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ." This mutual submission is the governing principle. Then he applies this: wives to husbands, husbands to wives (in the form of sacrificial love), children to parents, parents to children (in the form of not exasperating them), slaves to masters, masters to slaves (in the form of treating them as brothers).

The husband-wife passage has a unique Christ-church typology. But we must ask: Does Christ ever submit to the church? In His incarnation, Christ "did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made Himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant" (Philippians 2:6-7). Christ served the disciples, washed their feet, and died for them. His "headship" is exercised as servant-leadership. When husbands are called to love their wives "as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her," this is a call to complete self-sacrifice, not the exercise of typical authority. What kind of leadership requires the leader to die for the follower? This transforms the very nature of authority.

Moreover, if headship in this passage meant unilateral authority, it would contradict the mutual submission of verse 21. Paul is not establishing a one-way chain of command but applying mutual submission within the marriage relationship in ways appropriate to each spouse. The wife's submission is one expression of mutual submission; the husband's sacrificial love is another. Both are called to give themselves for the other. This is not hierarchy but mutual self-giving.

I appreciate these probing questions. They have helped clarify key aspects of the egalitarian position and the biblical foundations for it. I look forward to the closing statements.
