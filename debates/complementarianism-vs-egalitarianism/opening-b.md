# Opening Statement - Egalitarian Position

Honored moderator, worthy opponent, and those assembled—today I affirm that men and women are created equal in dignity, value, authority, and calling, and that both are biblically free to exercise leadership and service in the home, the church, and the world. This is not a modern innovation but the recovery of God's original design and the fulfillment of His redemptive purposes.

The foundation of human identity is Genesis 1:27: "So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them." Both man and woman bear God's image equally, without hierarchy or distinction in worth. When God creates woman as the man's "helper" (ezer), this term—used most often in Scripture for God as Israel's helper—connotes strength and support, not subordination. They become "one flesh," a unity that speaks of partnership, not a chain of command. The creation mandate to "fill the earth and subdue it" is given to both, establishing shared authority and responsibility. This original design was distorted by the Fall—Genesis 3:16 describes domination as part of the curse, not the Creator's intention. The gospel redeems us from the curse; therefore, why would we perpetuate in our homes and churches what Christ came to undo?

The New Testament announces that in Christ, the barriers that once divided have been dismantled. Galatians 3:28 declares, "There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." Just as the church eventually recognized that God's Spirit gifts Gentiles and slaves equally for leadership, so we must recognize that He gifts women equally. At Pentecost, Peter declared Joel's prophecy fulfilled: "I will pour out My Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy" (Acts 2:17-18). The Spirit distributes gifts "to each one, just as He determines" (1 Corinthians 12:11)—without regard to gender. Throughout Scripture, women lead God's people authoritatively: Deborah judges Israel; Huldah speaks God's word to king and priests; Priscilla instructs Apollos; Phoebe serves as deacon and patron; Junia is prominent among the apostles; Philip's four daughters prophesy. Mary Magdalene becomes the first witness of the resurrection, sent by Jesus himself to proclaim the news to the male disciples—an apostle to the apostles.

The passages that appear to restrict women must be understood in their historical-cultural contexts and in light of Scripture's broader trajectory. Ephesians 5:21 establishes mutual submission as the governing principle for all relationships: "Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ." The household instructions that follow apply this principle within existing social structures while subverting them from within. Paul calls husbands to a love that is more demanding than the wife's call to submission—sacrificial, Christ-like love that gives itself up. In 1 Timothy 2, Paul addresses a specific situation in Ephesus where uneducated women, influenced by false teaching, were domineering rather than serving. The rare Greek term authentein connotes usurping or domineering authority, not the proper exercise of godly leadership. The Bible's restricted passages address specific abuses, not the universal prohibition of women's God-given calling to lead and teach.

Egalitarianism celebrates the God-given differences between men and women while rejecting artificial hierarchy. It maintains order and structure in marriage through mutual submission, shared wisdom, and the recognition that different seasons may call for different forms of leadership. Authority is exercised based on gifting, character, and calling—not gender. Most importantly, egalitarianism reflects the heart of the gospel: the breaking down of dividing walls, the lifting up of the humble, and the creation of a new humanity where all are one in Christ. The church needs all the gifts God has given. When we restrict half the body of Christ from leadership, we impoverish the church and hinder the gospel. I look forward to exploring these truths together.
